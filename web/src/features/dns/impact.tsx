/**
 * The same four classes as dhcp's, weighted differently — and the difference is
 * the point.
 *
 * `restart` is *cheaper* here: DNS is stateless and clients retry unprompted, so
 * bouncing a resolver costs milliseconds and nobody notices. That is exactly
 * why internal/dns/plan.go concludes owning :53 is survivable.
 *
 * `disruptive` is far *worse* here. A DHCP server going away costs nobody
 * anything until their lease expires; a resolver going away costs everybody
 * everything at once, and it does not present as "DNS is down" — it presents as
 * the internet being broken. The label says that in the words the person will
 * actually use.
