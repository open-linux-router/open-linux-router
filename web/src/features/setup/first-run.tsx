/**
 * What to do next, on a box that has not been told to do anything yet.
 *
 * docs/system.md §1.3 settles what the *claim* screen is — one question, not a
 * wizard — and then hands the operator a dashboard reporting on a router that
 * is, so far, not routing anything: no interface adopted, no addresses handed
 * out, no names answered. Everything works and nothing is happening, which
 * reads as a broken install rather than a blank one.
 *
 * So this is not a wizard either. It is three rows on the page they already
 * landed on, each naming a thing the box cannot do yet and going straight to
 * where it is turned on. It is derived entirely from state and stores no
 * "dismissed" flag: there is nothing to dismiss, because it stops rendering the
 * moment the box is doing something.
 *
 * That last part is deliberate and is what keeps it from nagging. A box
 * deliberately serving DNS and no DHCP is a supported arrangement, not an
 * unfinished setup, so the panel leaves as soon as *either* service is on
 * rather than waiting for all three ticks.
