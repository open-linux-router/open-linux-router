/**
 * The devices that dialed in over WireGuard, as the map draws them.
 *
 * They are not `DeviceRow`s, and turning them into ones is the thing
 * docs/remote-access.md §3.3 refuses: `devices` is keyed by MAC, a peer is a
 * public key at the end of a tunnel, and inventing a hardware address so one
 * list could hold both would put a made-up NIC in the operator's own device
 * list — where the vendor lookup and the icon detection would then report on
 * it. The map reads the tunnel's own answer instead and shows what a tunnel
 * can actually say: the address it was given, whether it is connected now,
 * where it was last heard from.
 *
 * Existence is decided by `remote`, never by this module. A box with the
 * tunnel switched off gets nothing at all — no empty group, no "WireGuard is
 * off" card on a network map that is about what is on the network.

 * not imported or a port that is not reachable, while one last seen an hour ago
 * is working and asleep. And `unknown` is an absence of an answer where the
 * kernel could not be read at all, which must not be reported as "never".
