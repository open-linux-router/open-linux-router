 * learns — Home on the left, IoT on the right — and ordering groups by traffic
 * moved them every time the counters were read, which is the map rearranging
 * the house. They are in name order, the same as every group menu, at every
 * level.
 *
 * **Moving devices first, then recently heard.** Current download + upload
 * rate orders devices with measurable traffic. Everything else is ordered by
 * when the router last heard it, never by historical byte totals. This also
 * decides what the map folds into "+N more".
 *
 * That order changes every time the counters are read, and a node that moves
 * under the pointer is a node nobody can click — the reason the first version
 * of this map sorted by name and gave up on traffic. `frozen` is the answer
 * to both: while the pointer is over the map, the caller passes the ranks as
 * they were when it arrived, so nothing re-sorts until it leaves. Rates on
 * screen keep updating; only the order holds still.
 *
 * **Filtering hides, where it used to empty.** A search used to leave every
 * group drawn with "Nothing here matches" inside, which was fine for three
 * cards and is not for twelve containers of which two hold the answer. A group
 * survives a filter when anything below it does, or when its own name is
 * what was typed. Under the filters every group is also shown whole — a hit
 * folded into "+N more" is a search that looks like it found nothing.
