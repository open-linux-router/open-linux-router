/**
 * Where everything on the network map goes, worked out as numbers.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the DOM. Every box on the map has a size this module
 * decides — nodes are fixed within a range, text inside them truncates rather
 * than wraps, and a container is exactly as big as what it holds — so the whole
 * picture can be computed before anything is drawn, and the one thing the
 * browser has to be asked is how wide the map is and how big the router's box
 * came out. That is what makes the rest possible:
 *
 *   - Lines are drawn from the same numbers the boxes are placed with, so a
 *     line cannot end anywhere but on its box, on the first frame or any
 *     other. The previous map measured its cards after layout and drew from
 *     the measurement, and the frame between the two was the one where lines
 *     pointed at nothing.
 *
 *   - Moving between layouts — expanding a fold, switching density, focusing a
 *     group — is interpolating between two sets of numbers, and every box and
 *     every line is interpolated with the same curve over the same time, so
 *     they arrive together. See network-map.tsx for why that is enough.
 *
 *   - Harmony is a rule that can be written down and enforced, rather than
 *     whatever CSS grid made of the content that week.
 *
 * **One rule at every level: show at most K, fold the rest.** A container
 * shows at most K children, busiest first, and the rest go into one full-width
 * "+N more" row that opens in place. A container at or under K is never
 * folded: a network of a few dozen devices is seen whole.
 *
 * **Harmony is a grid.** Every top-level container is the same width, on
 * columns the page shares, and the rows of the grid start level. Inside each,
 * devices are one list, a row apiece and edge to edge, and a subgroup is an
 * inset box of its own beneath it. An earlier version sized each container to
 * its contents by scoring shapes, and the result was a row of boxes that were
 * each reasonable and together a mess — no two edges lined up. Uniform is
 * calmer than optimal. A container is as tall as its list, though: stretching
 * a group of one to the height of its neighbour of ten was a card of empty
 * white.
 *
 * **Lines reach one row, then run down columns.** Each column of the grid gets
 * a curve from the router into its first container, thickness by the whole
 * column's traffic, and every container below hangs off the one above it by a
 * short straight line. No line passes between two cards to reach a third —
 * which is what a curve from the router to a second-row card would have to do.
 * An earlier version drew more than one row inside one outline with a single
 * link into it, which put a box around boxes around lists.
 *
 * **Ways out are above the router.** The exits the router sends traffic to are
 * drawn as their own nodes over it, each with a line down into it: the picture
 * reads top to bottom as the internet, the router, the house.
