/**

 * gateway counts per *address × exit*, not per device, and only as running
 * totals (internal/gateway trafficView). Both halves of what the map wants are
 * therefore worked out here, in the browser:
 *
 *   A device is its addresses. Its rows are the ones whose address is one of
 *   `device.ips`, summed over every exit — a laptop with an IPv4 and two IPv6
 *   addresses going out two ways is six rows and one device. An address nobody
 *   on the device list holds still counts toward the box total; it just has no
 *   row to be drawn on.
 *
 *   A rate is the difference between two polls divided by the difference in
 *   their `as_of` stamps, never by the poll interval: a backgrounded tab polls
 *   late, and dividing by the interval would report the late sample as a burst.
 *
 * Differences are taken per row, not per device, so a row that appears between
 * two polls — a device's first packet through a new exit — counts from zero
 * rather than dragging its sum. A row that went *down* was reset (counting
 * toggled, the table rebuilt), and reads as 0 rather than as a negative rate
 * or the whole of its new total arriving in ten seconds.
 *
 * What it cannot see is set by what is counted: only traffic crossing the
 * router. Two devices talking on the same network never reach the forwarding
 * path, so a busy NAS serving a laptop down the hall reads as idle here.
