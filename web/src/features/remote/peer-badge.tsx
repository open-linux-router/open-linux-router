/**
 * Four answers, not two, and the one that matters is "never connected".
 *
 * A device that has *never* connected almost always means the configuration was
 * never imported, or the port is not reachable from outside — a setup problem
 * with somewhere to look. A device last seen yesterday is working and asleep.
 * Collapsing them into "offline" would hide the only failure this module
 * reliably produces on a first install.
 *
 * Shared by the device list on the tunnel page and the device's own page, so
 * that one peer cannot read as "Connected" on one screen and "offline" on the
 * next. A last-seen time is a fact rather than a state, so it is plain text with
 * no dot — the row is not claiming health, only recency.
