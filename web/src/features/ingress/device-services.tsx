/**
 * The services this device is published as, and the way to publish another.
 *
 * One row, on two pages: a device on this network and a device that dialled in
 * over the tunnel. The match is the same for both because the module's two
 * upstream forms are the same — a `device` reference for something `devices`
 * knows by MAC, and a literal `host` for everything else — so a peer, which has
 * no MAC and is published by its tunnel address (docs/ingress.md §1.2), matches
 * on the address and nothing else.
 *
 * That is also why the add action takes its own link: a device prefills
 * `/access/ingress?device=<mac>`, a peer `?host=<address>`, and the dialog lands
 * on whichever target form the service will actually have.
