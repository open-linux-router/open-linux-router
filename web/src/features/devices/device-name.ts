 * What a name is worth when no source is saying it right now.
 *
 * A device has three possible names, in the order the backend resolves them:
 * the operator's, the hostname the client announced and still announces, or the
 * hostname it announced the last time it was here (internal/devices/seen.go).
 * The third is why a phone left in a bag for two days keeps its name on the map
 * instead of turning into a MAC — but it is history, not something the device is
 * saying now, so the surfaces that can afford a word say which one it is.
