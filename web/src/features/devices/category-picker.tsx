/**
 * Picks what a device looks like, by its picture.
 *
 * A drop-down would be smaller, but the thing being chosen *is* an image, and
 * choosing "nas" from a list of twenty-odd words to find out what it looks like
 * is a guess-and-check loop. Showing the pictures makes the choice the same
 * shape as the result.
 *
 * Two blocks, in this order, and the order is the whole arrangement:
 *
 *   1. **Brands**, one section per maker, for the pictures that are somebody's
 *      product — the iPhone, the Galaxy, the ThinkPad. Someone looking for the
 *      phone they own is looking for Apple, not for the thirty-first tile.
 *      Which makers get a heading is derived from the artwork rather than
 *      decided here; see BRAND_GROUPS.
 *   2. **Common**, one grid of everything that is nobody's product: the
 *      category pictures and their variants, mixed. Phones, NAS boxes, a
 *      washing machine, a four-bay NAS, a mini PC — the shapes you scan when
 *      you do not yet know the word for the thing.
 *
 * Brands lead because a brand is a name you already have; a kind of device is
 * what remains when you do not. That is also why this block is one grid and not
 * the six themed groups it used to be: a grid is scanned, and a table of
 * contents is not, and nobody decides whether the box in the hall is filed
 * under Home or Computing before they can pick it.
 *
 * Above both, one search box that answers from both catalogues — the pictures
 * in the bundle, matched on their labels and tags, and theSVG's six thousand
 * marks, matched on the daemon. Typing is the fast path for anyone who knows
 * the word, and it is the only path that can reach a picture filed under a
 * heading they did not think of.
 *
 * What each kind of tile stores, which is not the same for all of them:
 *
 *   - **A category** sets the category and clears any chosen icon, so the
 *     picture goes back to following category and vendor.
 *   - **A variant** — a 4-bay NAS — sets both too, and sits beside its
 *     category's own tile, where someone looking for their NAS will look.
 *   - **A brand's picture** — iPhone, MacBook — sets both: an iPhone *is* a
 *     phone, and the label should say so. This is the only road to the Apple
 *     pictures for a device whose randomised MAC hides who made it, which is
 *     most Apple devices.
 *   - **A theSVG mark** sets only the icon and leaves the category alone. A
 *     Proxmox box is still a server; the mark is how it is drawn, not what it
 *     is.
 *
 * Operating-system marks are no longer offered here, though stored `os/…`
 * values still draw (see `chosenIcon`). They are a third axis — what a machine
 * runs rather than what it is or who made it — and a picker of two blocks could
 * not hold three without one of them becoming the one nobody scrolls to.
 *
 * Categories without artwork are shown too, wearing a line glyph instead (see
 * DeviceIcon). Hiding them would be worse: the category is real and the label is
 * correct, and the operator's answer is worth storing now so that it is already
 * right on the day the picture lands.
