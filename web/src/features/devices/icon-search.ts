/**
 * Which pictures a typed query is asking for.
 *
 * The device picker's search box used to be theSVG's alone: six thousand brand
 * marks were matched on the daemon while the hundred-odd pictures that ship
 * inside `olrd` could only be reached by scrolling to them. That is backwards
 * for a router. The common answer to "what is this thing" is a NAS, a phone or
 * a printer — a kind of device, not a maker — and the device pictures are the
 * ones that cover it. One query now answers from both catalogues, and this is
 * the half that runs in the browser, because the bundle is already loaded and
 * a keystroke should not be a request.
 *
 * What it matches is *words*, not substrings of a path: `nas` finds the
 * four-bay NAS, `mac mini` finds the Mac mini, and `storage` finds the NAS by a
 * word none of its labels say. The words a tile answers to are assembled by
 * features/devices/icons.ts, which is where the artwork and its tags live; this
 * module only decides which of them answer a query and in what order.
 *
 * Kept free of imports so the rule can be exercised without a bundler; see
 * icon-search.test.mjs.

 * How well `text` answers `query`, or -1 when it does not.
 *
 * The query is matched as a phrase, with the gaps between its words optional
 * on both sides — so "mac mini" finds "Mac mini" and "4bay" finds "4-bay NAS",
 * and neither has to know how the other spells the space. Anything more clever
 * than that (every word somewhere, in any order) starts answering queries with
 * tiles that merely share a word, which on a list this small is noise.
 *
 * Three grades, and the order is what makes a short result list usable:
 *
 *   0. The text *starts* with the query — "mac" opening "MacBook" — or a whole
 *      word *is* it, which is how the tags promote a picture to the front when
 *      someone types a word that is a household name for it.
 *   1. A word starts with each term — "mac" inside "iMac", "mini" inside
 *      "Mini PC". Still a real answer, found by name rather than by position.
 *   2. The query is merely somewhere inside — "nas" in "Samsung", for someone
 *      who typed it meaning the storage box. Worth offering; not worth leading
 *      with.
 *
 * A query of nothing but punctuation has no terms and matches nothing, which
 * is the honest answer.
