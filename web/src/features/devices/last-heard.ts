/**
 * When a device was last heard from, which is the only half of presence a
 * device at home can be honest about.
 *
 * `online` looks like an answer and is not one. It is true while a DHCP lease
 * is unexpired — twelve hours by default — or while the neighbour table holds a
 * complete entry, and the kernel keeps a STALE entry for a device that left an
 * hour ago. So "online" mostly means "somewhere within its lease period", and
 * an interface that lost its heatmap to it would be claiming knowledge nobody
 * has.
 *
 * A time is a fact: the router either heard from it or did not. So every surface
 * that used to say Online/Offline about a device on the LAN says when instead,
 * through these two functions, and a dialed-in device is the only one left
 * with a state — because `PersistentKeepalive = 25` makes three minutes without
 * a handshake mean the tunnel really is down (internal/remote/view.go).
 *
 * The words are one set for every surface, which is the point: a group row, the
 * device dialog and a network-map node used to say `Offline`, `Offline` and
 * `away` about the same device on the same screen.
