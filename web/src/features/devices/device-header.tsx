/**
 * The top of a device page: one big picture, one editable name, and the traffic
 * matrix behind both.
 *
 * Shared by `/devices/:mac` and `/devices/wireguard/:name` so that a device at
 * home and one that dialed in open the same way. The two pages used to draw this
 * block twice, and the copies drifted: the peer's kept the pointer on its title
 * block and the device's did not, which cost the peer two rows of activity dots
 * their hover ([311204f]).
 *
 * What is *not* shared is as deliberate. A name is the only editable thing here,
 * and both pages store it in a different place — `devices` in olr.json, `remote`
 * on the peer entry — so each page keeps its own editor and passes it in. What
 * follows the name is `status`, and only one page has evidence for one: a peer's
 * connection state is a fact about the tunnel (`PersistentKeepalive = 25` in
 * every configuration this router renders means a connected peer handshakes at
 * least every two minutes, so "no handshake for three minutes" really is "not
 * connected"), while a device at home has no equivalent — its lease outlives its
 * presence by hours and the neighbour table keeps a STALE entry looking complete
 * — so it gets no status at all. See docs/ui-content-guide.md.
 *
 * The key each page is addressed by — the MAC, or the peer's configured name —
 * is not drawn here. Both pages put it in their facts table, where it is a row
 * like any other identity, rather than a chip that only appears when the title
 * happens to hide it.
