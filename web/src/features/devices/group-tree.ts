 * picker in the UI — the device's Group select, "Move to group", "Move
 * inside…", the new-group dialog's parent — wants the same thing from that: the
 * tree, depth-first, so a subgroup is listed under its parent and indented by
 * its depth. One function so the four lists cannot disagree about the order.
 *
 * A parent that does not exist, or a chain that loops back on itself, cannot
 * come out of the API — Validate refuses both — but a hand-edited olr.json can
 * say anything, and such a group is listed at the top rather than dropped: a
 * group the picker leaves out is a group nobody can move a device into.
