 * being true the day `link` grew networks: the same endpoint writes addresses
 * to the kernel now, and its plan reports `disruptive` when it does.
 *
 * The narrower claim still holds and is the one to state: an *adoption-only*
 * change touches nothing on the box, so its plan is empty and the round trip
 * could only ever return "go ahead". That is a claim about the body rather than
 * about the module — it holds only while the caller sends the stored networks
 * back unchanged, which is exactly what features/link/interfaces-card failed to
 * do. Anything that changes a network belongs on useNetworkEditor's path, which
 * plans first and stops when the plan is disruptive.
 *
 * The one consequence worth warning about — a pool that will stop validating —
 * is not in this module's plan at all and is joined client-side by the card.
