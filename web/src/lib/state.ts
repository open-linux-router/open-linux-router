/**
 * The five things a status line is allowed to say, and the one table that
 * decides which is which.
 *
 * Before this file every surface chose its own word and its own colour, so
 * "Running" was green in one card and neutral in the next, and a failed read was
 * red on Overview and amber on Gateway. A reader cannot learn a language that
 * changes per page, so the tone of a word lives here and nowhere else: a call
 * site names a word from `STATE` and gets the tone that word always has.
 *
 * The words are still the product's words — "Not answering" means what it means
 * on Gateway and "Behind shared NAT" means what it means on DDNS. Sharing the
 * vocabulary is not sharing the sentence; `docs/ui-control-language.md` says
 * which words are legal and what each tone claims.
 *
 * `off` is the neutral tone and covers anything that is deliberately not doing
 * something: switched off, blocked, not applicable, nothing to report. It never
 * means "broken".
 * `unknown` is for an answer we do not have: still reading, unreadable, never
 * checked. It is a ring rather than a grey dot so it cannot be mistaken for `off`
 * at six pixels.
