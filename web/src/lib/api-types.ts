// Response shapes for the read and apply surfaces.
//
// KNOWN GAP, worth fixing rather than living with: these are hand-written,
// while config-types.ts is generated. design.md §3.2 rule 3 makes the Go struct
// the single source for every surface, and §6.2 says the read surface includes
// observed resources "declared alongside config" — but core reflects only the
// module's *config* struct today, so the view types in internal/dhcp/view.go
// reach TypeScript by being retyped here. A field renamed in Go breaks this
// file silently at runtime rather than loudly at compile time.
//
// The fix is to have core publish response schemas next to the config schema
// and extend scripts/gen-types.mjs to consume them. Until then, this file and
// internal/dhcp/view.go, internal/devices/view.go and internal/dns/view.go must
// be changed together — three copies now, not two.
//
// What closing it actually costs, recorded here so it is not re-derived:
//   - The view structs are unexported in all three modules (planView, queryView,
//     …), so core needs them exported, or a registration point beside the config
//     value Mount already takes.
//   - Impact is an int with MarshalText, so reflection publishes a bare `string`
//     and the unions below would *regress* unless Impact, ChangeKind and
//     ServiceAction each grow a JSONSchema() method — the move
//     internal/dns/schema.go already makes for UpstreamMode.
//   - `Plan` collides across modules in one flat generated file, so the
//     generator needs a per-module namespace it does not have today.
