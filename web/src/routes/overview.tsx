/**
 * What the router is doing, on the page you land on.
 *
 * This used to be two cards and a placeholder saying the rest arrived with link
 * and dial — which stayed on screen after three more modules shipped, so an
 * operator's first view under-described their own router and the most urgent
 * fact it held, a way out that had stopped responding, appeared nowhere. The
 * faults below the cards are where that answer lives now.
 *
 * The order is what an operator asks in order: is anything wrong, how much is
 * this network doing, and what is on it. The answer to the first is the
 * first card; faults follow the cards in full. Then the map, which is both the
 * only place three modules' answers are joined into one picture and the only
 * place devices are listed — including the ones that dialed in over the
 * tunnel, which are on no network this box serves and are drawn as what they
 * are rather than as device rows (docs/remote-access.md §3.3).
 *
 * The map has no toolbar. A search box, a network filter, a density switch and
 * a New group button sat between the counters and the picture on every visit,
 * for things done now and then; the picture chooses its own density, a new
 * group is made from any device's menu, and the other two have their own pages.
 *
 * The tree is organised by the operator's own groups, and is where they are
 * made, renamed and removed: a group only changes this picture, so the picture
 * is the place to change it, and a separate Groups page would be a screen whose
 * only effect is on a different screen.
 *
 * One device surface, deliberately. A flat list under the tree would have shown
 * the same devices twice on one screen — the exact duplication that took the
 * connected-devices card off the DHCP page — so the tree carries the search box
 * and opens the detail sheet itself.
 *
 * It polls more endpoints than any other screen. That is the cost of being the
 * one screen that saves you visiting the other three.
 *
 * Two of its views take the whole screen — the traffic map and the quality
 * assessment. Each is a state of this page with its own address (/map and
 * /quality) rather than a separate destination: they are opened from a card,
 * closed back onto it, and a shared link should show the thing that was open,
 * not the page it was opened from.
