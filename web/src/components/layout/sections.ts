/**
 * Every section of the app, and everything inside one.
 *
 * This table describes top-level sections and nested Gateway destinations. It renders in five
 * places now — the top bar, the tab bar, the page title, the settings list on a
 * section's landing page, and the header of every sub-page — because writing a
 * heading four times is four ways for it to drift.
 *
 * ## Why there is a second level at all
 *
 * Every section used to be one page holding everything it could do: DNS stacked
 * eight cards, each opening with two to four sentences, so an operator asking
 * "is DNS working" read a paragraph about DNS-over-TLS on the way past. The
 * writing was not the problem — a setting that can take down a house's internet
 * deserves a sentence saying so. Putting all of it on one screen was.
 *
 * So a section's landing page now answers two questions and no others: is this
 * working, and what is it doing. Everything that is a *setting* moves one level
 * down, into a page of its own, and takes its explanation with it. The long
 * blurbs below are that explanation — they are not shown in the list, only on
 * the page the row leads to, which is the moment they are worth reading.
 *
 * Networks, DHCP and DNS live under Gateway: the interfaces and subnets it
 * serves, the addresses it hands out, and the names it resolves belong together.
 * Wireless has its own placeholder section; Access follows it.
 *
 * Access is the directory of remote-access technologies; configuration stays
 * with its module. Advanced is the low-level plumbing and the machine itself:
 * System (firewall, the way in to configure it, port forwarding), Services
 * (Caddy, Dynamic DNS, multicast) and Diagnostics (the tools). Firewall and
 * Tools keep their URLs; Tools is flattened into the directory, its detail
 * pages remain.
 *
 * Devices is absent because it is not a section: the device list is the body of
 * the overview. Filing it under DHCP was considered and rejected — the
 * statically-addressed printer has never held a lease, and would have lived on
 * a page named for the protocol that has never seen it.
 *
 * Caddy is named for the proxy it runs, which is what an operator troubleshoots;
 * the module, the config field and the CLI still say `ingress`.
