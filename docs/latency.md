# Overview latency

`GET /api/gateway/latency` returns the latest background measurements without
starting network traffic. Internet and custom sites use the same metric: one
HTTPS HEAD request, timed from acquiring the established connection to receiving
the first response byte. DNS, TCP and TLS setup and document downloads are
excluded. This is an application round trip, including server processing, not
ICMP ping or a page-load measurement. There is no repeated sampling or aggregation.

Each probe has a 15-second deadline. Connections are fresh, environment proxies
are ignored and TLS certificates are verified. Redirects are not followed.
Any HTTP response, including errors and redirects, establishes response latency;
it does not assert that the application is healthy. A proxy accepting TCP or
answering ICMP locally cannot complete this authenticated HTTPS exchange on
behalf of an unreachable destination. Sites that reject HEAD can still return
a measurable HTTP error response.

Internet candidates use the router's default route. A monitored site can choose
a gateway exit; the probe then uses both halves of that exit: its DNS setting
selects where the name is resolved (mode `exit` uses the next hop on port 53,
`custom` the configured server, `olr` or none the router resolver), and the TCP
socket carries the exit's current routing mark on Linux. This matches what a
client of that exit experiences, including a fake-IP resolver whose answers
only the paired gateway can use. DNS time remains outside the sample; timing
starts once the connection is established. If a chosen exit is removed,
disabled or unsupported, no default-route fallback is attempted.
The DNS row independently times one lookup of `example.com` through the router.

The built-in Internet choices are Google, Baidu, Yandex and Cloudflare. With no
saved target, one round probes each once and saves the fastest successful
target to `gateway.latency_target` in `olr.json`. Subsequent rounds measure
only that target, including after restart. Failure never changes the target.
If all candidates fail, selection retries on the next one-minute round.
The Internet target and DNS continue their one-minute refresh independently of
monitored sites. Built-in and custom monitored sites run at minute 30 of each
router-local calendar hour, using `time.Local`; changing the Internet target
never triggers an extra site round. On startup before :30 the sampler waits;
after :30 it measures only targets without an attempt in the current hour. It
never fills earlier missing hours or overwrites a restored/manual current-hour
measurement merely because the daemon restarted.

`PUT /api/gateway/latency/target` accepts `{"target":"<listed URL>"}`; an empty
target requests a fresh selection. Changes wake the background monitor and
discard any in-flight Internet result from the old selection. GET stays passive.
The test page does not edit it; the route remains for API and CLI clients.

A click on one monitored site measures that site now.
`POST /api/gateway/latency/sites/{name}/measure` answers `202 Accepted` with the
current snapshot; only the clicked row's `measuring` flag is set until its probe
publishes. A second click while that probe runs is accepted and starts no second
probe. `POST /api/gateway/latency/measure` does the same for every site, which is the
page's Test all. API clients can pass `?category=<key>` (or `custom`) to limit
probes to that group; the merged table has no category refresh controls.
Background rounds leave every row's flag false, so a row spins
only where somebody asked. A row keeps its last completed value while the
probe runs. Other sites, the Internet target and DNS are left alone. These
routes change no configuration; they only ask for probes.

Common sites are part of the binary's catalog, not the operator's document.
They are present on a fresh install, always probed, and cannot be removed. The catalog carries one URL per site — the faster of the
app's main page and its static asset host, chosen from measurements on the
reference router — and a category (`communication`, `social`, `entertainment`,
`news`, `shopping` or `tools`). A CDN root may answer 403/404; the probe still
counts the response as the edge's latency. A per-operator probe exit
lives in `gateway.latency_common` as `{"name":"Google","exit":"Gateway2"}`,
and omitting an entry leaves that site on the default route.

Up to 20 custom HTTPS URLs can be stored with `PUT /api/gateway/latency/sites`
using objects such as `{"name":"NAS","url":"https://nas.example/","exit":"Proxy"}`.
The same route carries catalog entries: an entry whose name matches a common
site updates its exit and is not stored as a custom site. An empty array clears
the custom list but not the catalog. `exit` is optional and must name a
configured gateway exit. Names are unique and 1–40 characters; URLs cannot
contain credentials, custom ports or fragments. Custom sites live in
`gateway.latency_sites` in `olr.json`; measurements are stored separately in
the runtime database. A custom
site saved before the catalog existed, under a catalog name, moves to the
catalog with its exit preserved.

The /latency page uses one merged table for catalog and custom sites, with one
row per site and 24 fixed hourly positions for the router's current day (00–01
through 23–24). Each position holds the latest attempt begun in that calendar
hour; manual tests replace the same hour's point rather than appending another.
Missing hours remain empty, while failed attempts keep their error and a nil
measurement. The row shows the latest measurement and an explicit site test
button. Test all probes everything. Exits and custom sites are changed through
the API or CLI; pin selection is the page's configuration exception.

Each site's name area can pin or unpin it, with a small indicator for pinned
sites. The homepage Latency card shows only pinned monitored sites; no sites are
pinned by default. Pins are router configuration shared by all browsers and
survive daemon restarts. They do not affect which sites are probed or their
URLs, exits, latest results, hourly history, or in-flight probes.

`PUT /api/gateway/latency/sites/{name}/pin` accepts exactly one required boolean
field, `{"pinned":true}` or `{"pinned":false}`, and returns `200 OK` with the
full `LatencySnapshot` (including Internet `sites` and monitored `custom`). The
name is an exact, case-sensitive catalog or custom monitored-site name, URL
encoded as one path segment. Missing/null/nonboolean `pinned`, malformed JSON,
trailing JSON and unknown fields return `400 Bad Request`; an unknown site
returns `404 Not Found`, including when unpinning. Missing monitor/configuration
or a failed persistence operation returns `503 Service Unavailable`.

Repeating the same selection is a no-op. Selection lives separately in
`gateway.latency_pins` as an optional array of monitored-site names; an absent or
empty list means none. Successful changes publish the gateway `applied` event.
General gateway configuration changes are reflected in subsequent snapshots.
Saving configuration removes unknown/deleted custom-site names and duplicate
pins; deleting a custom site through either the site-list API or general
configuration therefore clears its pin before the name can be reused. Renaming
a custom site clears its old pin; changing its URL or exit under the same name
retains the pin. These display selections never enter runtime history.

The response includes `state` (`measuring`, `ok`, `unreachable`, `unavailable`),
nullable `milliseconds`, `dns_milliseconds`, `checked_at`, the selected
`target` name and `target_url`, built-in Internet `sites` and the `custom` list.
`local_time` is the current router-local RFC3339 time **with its UTC offset**, read
fresh for every snapshot. The `custom` list holds catalog sites (`builtin: true`,
with a `category`) followed by the operator's custom sites. A monitored site
includes `pinned: true` when selected for the homepage; false is omitted. It also
carries `measuring` while its on-demand probe runs, and chronological `samples`:
one latest attempt per router calendar hour retained for 48 hours. Each sample
has `milliseconds`, optional `error`, `checked_at` (the attempt's start in UTC),
and `hour_start` (the router-local hour's start with its offset). Frontends use
the calendar date/hour in `local_time` and `hour_start`, so the 24-slot view stays
consistent even when the browser and router have different time zones. A repeated
daylight-saving hour has distinct instants; a fixed 24-slot display uses the
latest attempt for that clock hour. A skipped hour stays empty.

Completed attempts are synchronously upserted to the `latency_samples` table in
`/var/lib/open-linux-router/runtime.db`, keyed by URL, exit and absolute hour
start. Runtime schema 4 adds this table without changing configuration. History
survives restarts, expires after 48 hours and has a 10,000-row database bound.
Changing a name/icon preserves measurements; changing the URL or exit does not
attach the prior target's measurements. The latest-started attempt wins when
manual and automatic probes finish out of order; a probe spanning midnight or an
hour boundary belongs to its start hour. Daemon cancellation clears progress
without inventing a failure. Database read errors are logged and probing stays
memory-only; write errors are logged, retain live results, and retry pending
samples on the next completion and shutdown. Runtime history is never written
to `olr.json`.

A failed fixed target retains its identity but clears its measurement.
Each site carries its latest attempt, nullable measurement and short error.
Custom sites keep their last completed outcome while the next probe runs;
a completed failure replaces success. Unmeasured sites show a dash, and
sub-millisecond results show `<1 ms`, never a rounded zero.
Browser-session caching uses a new hourly-history key; old rolling samples are
not merged back into snapshots, because durable history comes from the daemon.

The custom-site API preserves list order and accepts a custom icon. Icons may
use automatic favicon discovery through `GET /api/gateway/latency/sites/{name}/icon`,
a PNG/JPEG/WebP image (at most 96 KiB in stored form), or a theSVG icon ID.
Uploaded images are stored as validated base64 in the saved site configuration;
a theSVG ID names one of the marks bundled in `olrd`, which is served from the
binary and never fetched from a third party (`internal/brandlogo`). Supplying an
icon is independent of the latency probe.
