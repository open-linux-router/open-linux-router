# Page content review baseline

The objective is fast identification of useful information, a visible range of
OLR capabilities, and a calm, consistent interface. This record accompanies the
[content guide](ui-content-guide.md) and [visual guide](ui-style-guide.md).

| Pages | Review decision |
| --- | --- |
| Overview | Show Status, Traffic, Latency and Map; uptime leads Status. Omit System, information icons and the map legend/top-ten hint; retain charts and separate direction limits. |
| Quality report | One column: the overall-score band, then the five categories. No standalone transfer card, scoring-explanation block or evidence dump: the reference transfer sits under Speed, each service's attempts open under its own row (timings for Latency, sequence for Stability, outcome for Functionality), and NAT observations are an unscored diagnostic under Functionality. Measured coverage is the only figure with a hover hint. |
| Device | Separate observed facts from editable settings within the existing card; keep all fields; put the week's per-site activity and the device's DNS queries inside the inspection panel. |
| WireGuard device | The tunnel's answer, not the device list's: the label edited in place in the heading with the name beside it, the picture from the same picker a device uses, then address, public key, what it sends home and a way to replace the configuration file, last handshake and where from, with activity, current rate and totals from the address-keyed counters, the services published at its tunnel address in the same row a device page uses, and DNS queries by tunnel address. Omit vendor, group, reservation and per-device priority/limits — keyed by a MAC a tunnel does not have — and answer inspection with one word rather than a switch that cannot work. |
| Group | Preserve member lists and batch controls; remove repeated MAC/direct-membership prose; keep overwrite and non-inheritance consequences. |
| Device/group QoS | State that configuration is saved but not enforced; keep forms and shared group-cap semantics. |
| Inspection | Keep the existing panel and results; confirm privacy and CA consequences before starting; disclose lengthy preparation/scope and viewer details; retain session stop time and diagnostics. |
| Gateway | Interface cards in a wrapping grid with role, address and rates, each linking to the interface's own page, then two stacks — IPv4 and IPv6 — of seven cards each (Upstream, LAN, DHCP, Forwarding, Exit, DNS, with SLAAC or DHCPv6 in place of DHCP on the IPv6 stack, and a Routes card that counts routes and links to the read-only routing table) that state the stage's answer and link to the one page that changes it. No status strip and no switches — routing drift and all routing/forwarding switches live at interfaces#forwarding, and Overview reports faults. |
| Interfaces/routing and interface detail | Keep controls and all observed fields; carry link speed, every address, live rates, totals and the served DHCP range on the detail page, since the landing card no longer opens a dialog; shorten management and routing explanations without moving controls. |
| Exits | Preserve list/edit forms; distinguish blocking, unknown and failed checks; remove repeated failure prose. |
| Usage | Preserve measurement controls and counters; show a uniquely matched device name with its address; download precedes upload; disclose accounting limitations. |
| External routing rules | Distinguish loading, failure, unknown and empty; preserve readable raw evidence and provide retry. |
| DHCP details, ranges, reservations, advanced | Put status/details first; preserve lists, range forms and address fields; concise headings and managed-configuration constraints. |
| DNS details, blocking, names, upstream, listening, enforcement, advanced | Preserve filters, values and forms; group activity accounting metadata; shorten repeated explanations; retain binding, TLS verification and protocol limitations. |
| Firewall | One vertical Sankey with three visual rows: external semantic categories above one virtual OLR / Firewall node, trusted/LAN and router-local categories below. Both sides arrive at OLR; outer nodes state source and Allowed/Blocked decision. Use one actual packet scale and only nonzero categories. Matching conditions include source, destination, packets and bytes. Wrap labels and adapt chart width; overflowing charts scroll from the leading edge with a visible hint. Preserve switch and warnings; native, disabled, unverified and unavailable counters do not claim automatic traffic measurements. Editing lives at `/firewall/rules`. |
| Access | Remove duplicate hero introduction; keep the established directional groups, and link each tile straight to its configuration page or project documentation instead of a dialog. |
| SOCKS5 outbound | Keep status, authentication and address fields; concise support scope and routing next step. |
| WireGuard and SOCKS5 server | WireGuard answers on one card: its state, switch, public address and server key together, with the device list below it. SOCKS5 keeps its status and password card. Remove duplicate WireGuard labels and onboarding prose; retain exposure and password information. |
| HTTPS ingress | Preserve certificate details and all service domains/targets; show configuration counts accurately; keep service-authentication warning. |
| Port forwards | Keep shared routing switch and counters; distinguish unknown rules from inactive rules; configuration counts do not promise public reachability. |
| External filtering | Distinguish loading/error/unknown/empty; retain policy and counters without claiming end-to-end connectivity. |
| Tools directory | Use five consistent Lucide outline icons on themed surfaces, full names and chevrons; remove baked-in raster backgrounds. |
| All five tool operations | Preserve inputs/results and router-originated measurement scope; remove duplicate page subtitle; shorten selector hints; retain bandwidth and privacy consequences. |
| Advanced | Keep existing capability entries; remove generic shell description. |
| DDNS | Preserve provider/source/publication information and forms; explicit loading/error/unknown status; short empty state. |
| IPTV | Keep signal-path/source-prefix forms and preview/apply flow; concise prerequisites; disclose long scope limitations; pending status is not off. |
| Administrator access | Keep password/security controls; remove redundant introduction. |
| Credits | One ungrouped table with no visible header row, no section rows and no website column: the first column is the project mark and name as one link, followed by version and usage. Keep every feature-carrying project and the libraries that implement a listed feature (pro-bing, for example), with full dependency and license lists linked from the manifests; stacked records below 768px. |
| Sign-in, initial setup, first-run, not-found | Preserve existing components and safety consequences; concise setup steps and missing-page message. |
| Dialogs | Retain existing common fields, advanced disclosures and apply previews; remove redundant exit-name help; inspection consent uses the shared Dialog. |

Review does not require changing every file. Keep useful existing content and
layouts where they meet the standard. Future iterations should validate empty,
populated, loading and error states as well as desktop/mobile and both themes.
Browser fixture checks validate presentation, not live router networking.

## Visual consistency review — 2026-10-12

Reviewed all 43 current pages and entry states at 1440px, 375px and 768px,
plus desktop dark mode (172 captures). Coverage includes device/group details,
all Gateway/DNS/DHCP pages, Firewall, all Access pages, all five diagnostics,
Advanced/DDNS/IPTV, administrator access, Credits, not-found, both sign-in
methods, setup and first-run. Opened the add dialogs for exits, DHCP ranges and
reservations, DNS blocking and local names, and port forwards on desktop and
phone. No browser exceptions or page-wide horizontal overflow were observed.
The synthetic ingress service icon is absent; its intended fallback is shown.

Corrections: use one centered 1280px shell for every route, align Overview metric
heading line boxes, keep the health dot beside its label on phones, replace
background-baked tool illustrations with consistent themed outline icons, and
let switch panels share the page boundaries while retaining readable form widths.
Administrator password controls keep a 720px maximum inside their full-width card.
Existing device imagery and useful monitoring/data space are preserved.

Validated with Node 24 web lint/build/tests and Go 1.27 Linux vet/tests. Lint has
existing warnings; production build retains the existing bundle-size warning.
The environment lacks make, so the Go commands behind make check were run directly.

## Gateway landing review — 2026-10-21

The page read as unfinished for structural reasons rather than colour: two
levels of border around the interface cards, a right-hand column 120px taller
than what it summarised (leaving an empty band inside the panel), a second set
of section headings indented 68px behind the first, 660px service cards holding
200px of content, and three wordings of "Details".

Corrections: interface cards lost the 9px role text and the two 3px squares drawn
on the shared glyph — the role is now a badge beside the name, and the card
carries name, state, address and rates only. The interface grid wraps instead of
scrolling locally, so a fourth NIC is not hidden at the edge. Way out and
Services are panels of their own, so every block on the page is a Card with the
same title contract, and the DHCP/DNS rows are links with their state on the
right.

It then went further than a shared strip. A status strip was tried and removed:
its one switch was a one-click way to take every network behind the router off
the internet and close its forwarded ports, and without the switch the strip
repeated the routing details page. Routing state, drift, the module switch and
the IPv4/IPv6 forwarding switches all live at interfaces#forwarding, beside the
sentences that say what turning them off closes; Overview reports a gateway
fault. The landing page is the objects only, and the Interfaces heading is its
single settings entry.

Validated against fixture data at 1440×1000, 1024×1000, 768×1200 and 390×1200
in both themes, plus the empty, loading and error states of each panel and the
interface page. No page-wide overflow or horizontal scroll at 375px. Hash
targets `#interfaces`, `#dhcp` and `#dns` still scroll. Mocked browser checks
validate presentation, not live networking.

## Interface cards review — 2026-10-21

The landing card opened a dialog holding what the card could not: the network
it carries, the negotiated link speed, MAC, every address and both totals. A
dialog is the wrong shape for that — it is a page's worth of readings behind a
click, with its own "Interface settings" link at the bottom — so the card now
links straight to the interface page and the dialog is gone.

The interface page took over the readings and gained the two that were only ever
on the tile: what it is moving now and what it has moved in total, both read from
the same NIC counters as the card. It also states the DHCP range its network
serves and how much of it is in use, so "this interface's LAN is running out of
addresses" is visible where the interface is inspected rather than one link
away. Everything the dialog held is still reachable, and the keyboard path is
shorter: one tab stop to the page instead of button → dialog → tab into it.

## Gateway stacks review — 2026-10-21

The page answered "what is this box plugged into" and then left the operator to
work out the rest. IPv6 in particular was one line in Way out: the delegated
prefix, the LAN's /64, whether anyone advertised it, whether the kernel
forwarded it, and whether an exit dropped it were each in a different module,
and finding them required knowing which module owned which half.

Way out and Services are replaced by two stacks, IPv4 and IPv6, each cut across
the modules in packet order: Upstream, LAN, DHCP, Forwarding, Exit, DNS, with
the clients card reading SLAAC or DHCPv6 on the IPv6 stack. Each card states
that stage's answer for that family and links to the one page that changes it,
so the question "is IPv6 working, and where do I fix it" is answered without a
module map. Missing stages are named in the card — no /64, nobody advertising,
forwarding off — instead of being absent, because an absent row reads as
"nothing to do" rather than "not configured". The clients card is titled for
what an operator came to change: DHCP on IPv4 — the module's name and the word
they arrive with — and the protocol running on IPv6: SLAAC, DHCPv6, or both when
networks differ. Those are terms an operator already knows, and that card opens
the address ranges that carry each network's advertisement mode. The Forwarding
card reports what its switch decides rather than where the sysctl was written:
devices reach the internet or they do not, with NAT and the port-forward count
beside it on IPv4.

Each stack ends with the routing table, drawn as a seventh card of the same kind
although it is not a stage and not a module: every card above writes into it and
the kernel consults it after all of them. It sits in the family's own stack
because a route table is per family — a block below both stacks named IPv4 and
IPv6 a second time and asked the reader to hold two places at once for one
family's routing. It counts routes, says whether that family has a default route
and whether any of its tables belongs to somebody else; its page lists every
route grouped by table — the box's main table, each exit's own table with the
rule priority that selects it, and any table a foreign rule points at — and is
read-only, because a static route is its own object and a page reporting the
table must not become a second place to write it.

The stacks are a read model. Every card is a link: no draft, no plan, no apply
of its own, so the same module appearing once per family is one object seen
twice and cannot disagree with itself. That is also why the page can afford two
full stacks without becoming a second settings page, and why design.md §4.3's
"no page that sets IPv6 across modules" still holds — it is amended there to
name this view explicitly.

Hash targets stay: `#interfaces` is the interface card, and
`#dhcp`/`#dns`/`#routes` still land on the IPv4 DHCP, DNS and Routes cards,
though the settings trees now open the section pages themselves. The interface
card is unchanged, and every previous Way-out fact — both routes, the
resolvers, the unmanaged-rule count — has a home
in the stacks except the unmanaged rules, which remain on interfaces#forwarding.

Validated as a read-only page: lint, type-check, unit tests and a production
build pass. Live router state was not available, so the cards were checked
against types and fixtures, not against a running box.

## WireGuard card review — 2026-10-21

The page opened with two cards that each held half of one answer. A status strip
counted "1 of 2 connected" above a list that already names every device and ends
each row with exactly that state, and below it a settings card carried the switch
whose consequence the strip repeated in a second voice ("Devices connected over
WireGuard can reach every address on your network"). Neither card was wrong, and
neither was what somebody came to the page for.

They are one card now: the mark and the title, the tunnel's state as a word
beside it, the Settings button and the switch on the same line, then the three
facts the device list cannot give — where devices dial, the network their
addresses come from, and the key they check. **The word follows the box and the
switch follows intent**, so a reboot that leaves the settings stored and the
interface gone reads "Not running" with the catch-up alert directly above it,
and "we could not tell" stays its own answer rather than becoming a fault. The
off state keeps one sentence, because a list of saved devices looks identical
whether or not the tunnel is up.

The count is gone rather than moved. A row already ends in Connected, an elapsed
time or Never connected, so "1 of 2" summarised the rows directly underneath it.
What remains above the list is what a page's first glance is for: blockers, a
foreign interface, drift, and a public address that has not been set.

Validated against fixture data at 1440×900 in both themes and at 390, 375 and
320 wide, in the running, off and unknown states: no page-wide horizontal
overflow, and the switch stays reachable at every width the card title wraps at.
Live router state was not available, so this checks presentation rather than
networking.

## WireGuard device configuration — 2026-10-21

The page could describe a device completely and could not give back the one
thing that gets lost. A configuration file is handed over once and its private
key is stored nowhere (remote-access §4.1), which is deliberate and stays: there
is no file to re-serve. What was missing was the honest next step, which used to
be "remove the device and add it again" — a path that renumbers it, drops its
label and drops its picture, and was written down only in the dialog that shows
the file, at the moment nobody needed it.

The facts table now ends that question with a Configuration row: a New file
button whose tooltip says why there was nothing to download, a confirm dialog
that states the loss (that device cannot dial in until the new file is imported,
which the daemon classifies as disruptive and refuses without it), and then the
same handover dialog an added device gets, saying once and only once. The name,
the address, what it sends home and its picture do not move.

The command is the same operation under the vocabulary that already exists:
`olr remote set peer <name> --new-key` prints the file rather than drawing it,
and refuses to be combined with a rename, because a handover and a label
change answering one exit code would be a lie about which one failed.

Validated with fixture responses for the whole sequence — row, refusal, confirm,
handover — at 1440×1000 and 390×844, plus lint, type-check, unit tests and a
production build. The daemon side is covered by
`TestReissuingADeviceReturnsANewConfiguration`; live router state was not
available, so the presentation check runs against fixtures.

## WireGuard device actions — 2026-10-21

The Configuration row put a button inside a table of facts, and the fact it
labelled was "there is a file, once". As a row it named a category rather than
the thing an operator is missing, and its button, New file, referred to a file
that does not exist until it is clicked. It also ended the card in a band under a
rule, because a footer was where page-level actions had always been put.

The two actions a dialed-in device has — hand it a new setup file, edit it — are
one pair now, in the lower right corner of the card, in the space the three
counters leave beside the taller facts column. There is no rule: the pair belongs
to the facts above it, and a line would announce another section of the page in
a card that has none. The button names what the click hands over, so the row that
had to explain it is gone; why the file cannot be downloaded again stays in its
tooltip and in the confirm dialog, which is where the loss is decided.

Validated against the scratch daemon at 1440×1000 and 390×844, in both themes,
with no horizontal overflow, and clicked through to the handover dialog from the
moved button. The daemon side is unchanged.
