# UI content and presentation standards

The visual direction is a precise, calm network console. Content must support
that direction: users should identify the important information before reading
supporting text. This guide complements [the visual guide](ui-style-guide.md).

## Start with the user's decision

Advanced's System group includes Backup. The backup page distinguishes a
credential-bearing configuration export from runtime or whole-machine backups.
Selecting a restore file validates it first; replacement requires a separate
explicit action showing scope, credential changes and the recovery deadline.
Preserve the original JSON bytes in both directions, including uint64 values.

Disruptive network changes require a second decision after application. A global
recovery notice shows the remaining confirmation time, Keep changes and Revert
now. Never confirm automatically on a successful API response or page load.
Keep failed recovery and lost connectivity visible; explain how to reconnect to
the previous address after the countdown.

Device priority and speed limits apply automatically, without an enable switch.
Use “applied” only after observing matching runtime state. Show pending device
placement and apply failures explicitly. Blank means unlimited. Keep the user
workflow focused on per-device priority and speed limits; do not add aggregate
QoS settings to Gateway or imply they are required for device limits.

Before adding content, write down the page's primary task and what the user needs
to decide next. Give each visible element a purpose in that decision. Remove
repeated or unrelated information; move useful later-stage information to the
stage where it is needed.

| Page type | Primary question | Lead with | Supporting content |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Directory / entry | Which capability do I need? | Recognizable names and distinct imagery | A short distinction only if names are ambiguous |
| Monitoring | What is happening, and what needs attention? | Current state, important changes, key measurements | Units, freshness and scope beside the data |
| Configuration | What am I changing? | Current value and its control | Necessary constraints, consequences and apply action |
| Diagnostic operation | What should I run? | Target, essential options and run action | Requirements and measurement scope |
| Diagnostic result | What happened, and what next? | Outcome and decisive measurements | Evidence, limitations and a relevant next action |

Apply these rules to existing pages as well as new features. The page-by-page
[review record](ui-page-review.md) documents the current baseline.

## Simplification preserves data and consistency

Reducing clutter does not mean reducing every data display. First remove repeated
introductions, obvious instructions and duplicated labels. Then clarify grouping,
ordering and state. Do not shrink metric cards, value typography or chart space
to make a page appear quieter. Overview cards may reduce padding and row height
to improve density while preserving values, units and mobile interaction targets.
Section landing pages omit titles duplicated by navigation, retaining a visually
hidden page title. Detail and operation pages keep their identifying titles.

- Overview shows Status, Traffic, Latency and Quality cards. Traffic's
  title-right map icon toggles statistics and map views in place. Its pressed
  state identifies the active map, and its accessible label names the next view.
  The fullscreen map has its own /map address. The
  quality radar shows Speed, Latency, Stability, Wireless and Functionality
  on a 0–100 higher-is-better scale. Wireless defaults to 80 when unmeasured or
  stale; explain this display-only default in details and the accessible chart
  description. Other missing or stale axes show a dash. Draw a polygon when all
  five axes have display scores. Omit the card total and measured-category caption.
  Details show the total out of 100 using normalized weights of current scored
  categories and components. Missing tests never reduce the score; measured
  failures still count. Clicking Quality or its chart opens the fullscreen assessment view. It leads
  with the overall score, one display grade, the count of scored categories and
  the measured coverage, with the reference transfer's download and upload rates
  beside them: the numbers a reader can check lead, and the score stands next to
  what produced it. Categories follow in one panel; each names the score in a
  fixed column and states what it measured in that category's own units —
  throughput, median and variation, expected responses, reachable services.
  Never repeat a category state as a word on every row: "partial" describes the
  unfinished half of the catalogue, not this connection, and the coverage bar
  already says how much was scored. Only a state the operator can act on, such
  as an outdated result, earns a label. Expanding a row lists its tests; a
  service test item can rerun just that service, and a category heading can
  rerun every test behind that category. Unmeasured categories are excluded from
  the total. Raw service and NAT evidence and the scoring explanation stay in
  collapsed Measurement details. The page always includes the reference transfer, so replace the old
  optional-bandwidth switch with one short line at the run action; keep freshness
  and the router-default-route scope visible without restating the workflow.
  The view has its own /quality address. Snapshot reads never start
  tests. Clicking the Latency title opens
  latency settings, without a separate plus button. The dialog starts with an
  Internet target selector: a named provider or “Choose fastest once”. The
  selected target stays fixed across failures and restarts. Show the latest
  single HTTPS latency sample, with `<1 ms` for sub-millisecond values; keep
  DNS lookup simple and omit bandwidth tests. Monitored sites follow the target.
  Clicking one monitored site measures that site again in place without opening
  the dialog; replace only that site's value with a spinner until its probe
  lands, and keep the title as the only settings control. Say when the request
  to measure failed, and read measurements without starting any.
  Status itself is the sentence — all systems OK, needs attention, not set up,
  checking, status unavailable — and it is the card's headline; clicking it opens
  the system-health dialog. Uptime and the public address follow beneath it, not
  above it. Click uptime for a dialog with CPU, memory and root disk used/total
  values; omit the separate System card. The health dialog lists DHCP, DNS and
  Gateway states with links to their pages, and distinguishes checking,
  unavailable, disabled, needs attention and OK; retain the visible fault alerts
  below the cards.
  Latency and Map have no information icons. Traffic flips to reveal its map
  on the back, without a Map details row;
  clicking the enlarged grayscale map opens a viewport-filling color map,
  with a close control and Escape support. Country colors distinguish geography,
  while download/upload retain their semantic colors.
  omit the inline direction legend and top-ten summary.
- Overview Status shows one public-network summary using IPv4's country flag,
  city and ISP. Its row opens a dialog showing IPv4, IPv6 when available, ASN and ASN
  Organization from the IPv4 lookup, in that order; label the organization “Org”.
- Keep download and upload limits beside their respective measurements; separate
  controls serve separate decisions and are not automatically redundant.
- Overview cumulative traffic uses Download then Upload labels, each with
  its byte unit. Preserve unavailable states rather than
  displaying zero when counting is disabled or a read fails.
- Group Overview live traffic and utilization separately from cumulative traffic,
  site probes. Align section starts across desktop cards while keeping
  each group's internal spacing suited to its content; Status remains one list.
- Keep common configuration fields, addresses, counters and useful evidence
  visible. Do not move them into disclosures solely to shorten a page.
- Reuse existing headings, Card, ListRow, StatusStrip, fields and Dialog. Do not
  invent a compact card, new density tier or special layout for each feature.
  Choose shared size variants: MetricValue sm for inline measurements, md for
  summaries and lg for diagnostic results; Card's sm/default spacing is separate
  from Heading's sm/md/lg emphasis. Unavailable latency is never a zero result.
- Disclose lengthy technical explanations and infrequently used advanced options.
  Keep prerequisites and consequences beside the action they affect.
- A page can pass review without a visible redesign. Preserve a coherent existing
  presentation when its content already supports the user's task.

## State and data contracts

Quality assessments run on demand from the fullscreen assessment view opened by
the card heading or chart. The page always includes the reference transfer. A
full run replaces the snapshot; rerunning one category or service test reuses
the other evidence, merges the fresh result and recalculates every affected
score. While a rerun is in progress, keep the last scores visible, disable the
other rerun controls and say which test is updating. Measured scores do not
expire; results survive daemon and router restarts. The result view labels the
same reference score Excellent 90–100, Good 75–89, Fair 60–74 or Poor below 60;
the label is presentation, not another calculation. Not tested, cancelled,
timed-out and unscored states replace the number with a dash, and a running
assessment shows progress there instead; each carries one sentence saying what
happened and what to do next. Missing data is never shown as zero.

World traffic combines IPs at the same remote coordinates into one map connection.
Line width represents that connection's combined upload and download relative
to the busiest one; per-IP rates stay in details. Arcs are one amber
hue, outside the map's country colours, and each connection has one neutral dot
that travels out and back, illustrating both directions without selecting a
direction based on traffic volume.

Ingress distinguishes saved repairs from applied settings. When other existing
errors prevent application, say the repair was saved, list the remaining service
names and problems, and explain that the running proxy stays unchanged until
the final repair applies automatically. Retain this warning after refresh.

World traffic uses two-second sampling and UI refresh. Smooth map transitions communicate
continuity between samples, not individual packets or exact connection lifetimes;
the details ranking and rates continue to show the latest observed snapshot.
World traffic ranks remote IPs over a rolling thirty-second observed window,
then locates only the top forty using cached ip.sb city lookups. Details show
city (or region) and country; arcs use only valid returned coordinates,
omitting IPs without coordinates. State that IP locations are approximate in the
details dialog, which also carries the sampling caveats and ip.sb attribution. The fullscreen
administrative map adds country, province/state and major-city names progressively
on zoom, stopping at regional detail because IP locations are approximate; it
shows no title, legend, summary, status or credits, only the map and a close button.
Country fill colors distinguish geography and carry no traffic or status meaning.
Traffic has no GeoIP city, region or country labels. Map labels use bundled
geography and local fonts, without fetching an external basemap.
Show their share of observed traffic in the details dialog,
and retain unknown locations in that denominator. Never imply
zero activity is a failed read, or sampled conntrack
bytes equal whole-router totals. Details name short-connection and bypass
limitations, warm-up, counting-disabled and unavailable states.

Distinguish loading, read failure, unknown, empty, disabled and healthy states.
No response is not an empty rule set; saved configuration is not proof of a
running service or end-to-end connectivity. Use neutral pending/unknown styling,
an explicit error and a retry where useful. Name configuration counts as such.

Firewall monitoring retains semantic permission categories and adds incoming
source as a separate dimension. Use one vertical diagram with three visual
rows: external semantic categories at the top, one virtual OLR / Firewall node
in the middle, and LAN/trusted and local categories at the bottom. Both outer
rows show arrivals at OLR, not an external-to-LAN forwarding path. Each category
shows its name and packet count; position conveys source and color conveys the
Allowed/Blocked decision. Keep full source and decision text in tooltips, without
repeating them on each node. Omit explanatory paragraphs and the matching-conditions
disclosure below the diagram. Hide zero-traffic categories and
sources. Path widths use log(1 + packet count) weights normalized separately
for each side, with a 4px minimum so small categories remain visible. Retain exact
packet labels and byte totals and matching conditions in tooltips.
Keep unavailable counters distinct from a verified zero-traffic state.

Show QoS as saved configuration until enforcement exists.
Device details group stable identity and saved settings on the left, live
uplink, priority and live traffic on the right. Reuse Overview rate meters with
Download and Upload labels beside narrower bars, without arrows.
Total below Upload shows download then upload with the Overview arrows, added up
over the same retained history the title matrix draws, so a reader can check it
against the cells above it; it states no window of its own, because the matrix
beside the title already is that window's picture. Unavailable history shows
dashes. Services below Group lists matching configured services as icons that
open their webpages, with an equally sized add action that opens Ingress and
prefills the current device. Empty lists show only the add action.
Devices without a reserved name/address prefill their observed host instead.
A device that dialed in draws the same row, matched by its tunnel address, and
its add action prefills that address rather than a device reference.
Group is a tag that opens its edit dialog.
Compact Uplink and Priority segmented selectors lead the right column, in that
order. Uplink selections retain network-change confirmation and apply feedback.
On desktop, pair Vendor with Uplink, MAC with Priority, IP with Download,
Group with Upload and Services with Total in shared rows. Place read errors and
traffic availability messages after those rows so they do not shift the
corresponding values.
The title's activity matrix shows one day per column, newest
on the right, and six four-hour periods from top to bottom. The displayed date
range adapts to the available width, with fixed square cells; dates without
retained history remain explicitly missing data. Leave future periods
blank and show download/upload totals immediately on hover or focus. Format the
time as `10-14 4:00-8:00`, followed by traffic only; omit sampled/progress wording.
A device page reports identity and settings, and leaves presence to the lists and
the map. It draws no Last heard and no Way in row, and the hardware address is a
fact row rather than a chip beside the title. Lists, the network map and the
device dialog still report when a device was last heard, never whether it is
online: a DHCP lease outlives presence by hours and the kernel keeps a stale
neighbour entry looking complete, so Online would be a claim this box cannot
support; Last heard is the fact it can. The one exception is a device that dialed
in: every configuration this router renders carries a keepalive, so three minutes
without a handshake really is a broken tunnel, and that page alone says
Connected; the map draws the same fact as a dot rather than a word.
Its Last heard (the handshake) and Way in (the tunnel interface and subnet) stay,
because the tunnel is the only thing that can answer them, and its configured
name is a fact row in the same place the device page puts its MAC.
Speed bars open download/upload limit dialogs; keep the
configuration-only caveat in those dialogs and save feedback, without a status row.
Omit Notes and the QoS heading.
Device activity sits at the right of the title bar, without visible
explanatory text. Only the current period breathes with live combined download/upload
speed: faster traffic means faster breathing; idle or unavailable rates stay steady.
Rate updates smoothly change playback speed without resetting the breath.
On becoming idle, complete the current breath before settling at full brightness.
Historical colors continue to represent accumulated traffic.
The lowest nonzero tier (below 10 MiB combined upload/download per four-hour
period) uses a stronger neutral gray than zero/missing data; green starts at
10 MiB. Four green levels use the device's retained 90-day four-hour totals at or
above 10 MiB, split at 25%, 50% and 75% of the greater of the maximum total
and 1 GiB, independently of
screen width. These divide the byte range, not the number of cells.
Values equal to a boundary use the lighter tier; identical totals share a color,
and a flat or single-sample history below 1 GiB follows the same minimum reference. Different devices'
greens represent their own relative traffic, not comparable byte quantities.
This distinguishes low traffic without implying whether a person is
actively using the device.
Immediate four-hour hover/focus hints show sampled download and upload
or explicitly report missing/unavailable data. Partial samples are not exact
four-hour totals. History is joined to the device's currently observed addresses.
It begins accumulating after daemon startup. Sampling runs every ten seconds and
the matrix refreshes every minute; the first reading establishes a baseline.
History retains at most 90 days and is restored from
SQLite's `activity` table in `/var/lib/open-linux-router/runtime.db` after
restarts/upgrades. Transactional
checkpoints run every minute and on normal shutdown; an abrupt power loss may
lose the latest minute. It is not reconstructed from cumulative counters. Changing
device addresses can hide samples associated with its previous addresses.

Device Uplink offers Default (inherit interface/system routing) and named
exits only. Existing explicit router-connection overrides remain accurately
displayed until the user selects Default or a named exit.
Use label/value pairs within each device-detail half. Keep units with their inputs and chevrons beside selected values. Lead identity rows with Vendor. Edit addresses and their fixed toggle
in a dialog opened by clicking the IP. Show a Fixed tag beside reserved addresses;
keep the hover hint limited to DHCP lease information and omit the hostname field.
Preserve diagnostic scope: router-originated tests do not measure a downstream device's path.
The Inspection switch starts and stops the session directly, without confirmation.
Explain credentials, certificate trust and cleanup in the setup guide.
Device Connections keeps Inspection and its switch in the title bar, with a
setup gear icon to the left of the label while active; keep the QR code and guide link inside the setup
dialog. Show the mitmproxy viewer directly, without duplicate request lists, diagnostics or a
disclosure. Certificate installation, trust and cleanup belong
in the public five-step setup guide, with the certificate download at step two.
Device DNS defaults to hidden records with an Inspection switch in its title bar.
Enabling it polls and displays Time, Record, Type and right-aligned Answer values
without a visible header row. An accessible search icon sits to the left of
Inspection and reveals a compact filter that opens to the left of itself;
closing clears the filter. Both inspection panels keep their title bars fixed
and expand content downward, and their Inspection label and switch keep their
place at the trailing edge as those controls appear.
DNS and Connections title bars show dividers only while their inspection is active.
Do not promise encrypted DNS blocking beyond the supported protocol and port.

Use download then upload consistently. Device names may supplement an address
only when the address uniquely identifies a device. Keep long domains, IPv6
addresses and provider errors readable rather than silently truncating them.

## Disclosure and hierarchy

Access groups technology tiles under “Networking”, “Add a way out” and “Add a way
in”. Keep WireGuard, Tailscale, NetBird, ZeroTier, Headscale, SSH, SOCKS5,
Gateway and HE Tunnel Broker in the directory. Shadowsocks, Trojan, VLESS, VMess,
Hysteria, TUIC, OpenVPN and IPsec are outside the product scope. Do not label the
directory as proof of legal compliance or describe removed technologies as a
statutory list of prohibited products.
A technology can appear in both directions; its tile goes straight to the
configuration owner for that direction, and a technology OLR does not configure
opens its project documentation instead. Remove System default and purpose
filters from this page. Use app-style icons above names without enclosing cards.
Use project logos for branded technologies, including frp's official icon.
SOCKS5 and Port forwarding use reviewed original app artwork with simple flat
functional shapes and no lettering; the name remains below each icon. Other
unbranded entries retain a capital initial on a tinted tile. The approved HTTP
and HTTPS artwork does not introduce directory entries or replace Caddy's mark.
Port forwarding is a forwarding rule rather than a remote-access technology,
so it is not a tile
here; it lives under Advanced with the firewall whose ruleset it shares.
Functions and state appear on hover/focus and in the tile's accessible name.
External technologies remain explicitly “Not integrated”; broader ecosystem uses
are not promises of OLR configuration support. Existing service states remain
authoritative.

Tunnel Broker keeps provider details together in one saved assignment, with
activation and LAN assignment as separate decisions. Saving defaults to off.
Show five sections on one page with sticky step navigation; omit the repeated
page introduction and back-link heading. Keep endpoint requirements and change
consequences visible; disclose server comparisons and technical explanations.

Overview group headers open the group's detail page directly on desktop and
mobile. The unnamed device bucket retains its in-place disclosure.
Keep service icons beside the compact activity column, leaving the remaining
row width for the device name.
Group details lead with parent, device counts and subgroup links beside bulk
uplink and priority controls in the device summary layout. Keep current-member
scope, replacement behavior and the priority enforcement caveat beside the
explicit apply actions; selected values are batch choices, not observed shared
settings. List member devices below the summary.

Gateway answers one question — does this router get its networks online — in two
layers, and has no status strip and no switches. The interfaces are the objects:
physical cards carry name, role, link state, address and current rates without
history charts, and open that interface's own page rather than a dialog, where
link speed, MAC, every address, live rates, totals and the served address range
live beside the switches that change them.

Below them are two stacks, IPv4 and IPv6, each naming the same six stages in the
order traffic takes them: Upstream (address, next hop, and for IPv6 whether it
is native, delegated or tunnelled), LAN (the subnets and how much of the pool is
in use), the clients stage, Forwarding (whether this family's traffic gets out,
and on IPv4 what it carries: NAT and the port forwards), Exit (direct, or which
exit carries it — and for IPv6 whether an exit drops it, since there is no NAT to
translate it) and DNS (the resolvers, and for IPv6 whether IPv6 name resolution
is enabled). The reading order is shared; the card labels are not required to
match. A card is named for what an operator came to change: DHCP on IPv4,
because that is the module's name and the word they arrive with; on IPv6, the
protocol that is running — SLAAC, DHCPv6, or both when networks differ. Those
are the operator's own words, so the card does not coin a name for the family.
Each card states its stage's answer and links to the one page that changes it; a
missing stage is named in its card rather than hidden. The stacks are a view cut
across the modules and hold no configuration of their own, so the same module
appearing under both families is one object seen twice. Drift and every routing
and forwarding switch remain at interfaces#forwarding; Overview reports a
gateway fault. Usage has no separate page; traffic counting lives in routing
details.

Below the stacks is the routing table itself, one card per family: the route
count, whether that family has a default route, and whether any table belongs to
somebody else. It is not a seventh stage — every module in the stacks writes
into this table, and the kernel consults it after all of them — so it gets its
own block rather than a card in the flow. Its page is read-only and groups every
route by table: the box's main table, each exit's own table, and any table a
rule outside OLR points at. A table is not a setting, so the rows live there and
the card carries only the counts.

Open newly navigated pages at the top so their title and primary information are
visible. Preserve section targeting for hash links and scroll for query-only changes.

Default to two content levels: the main information and necessary context.
A third level needs a specific reason, such as a consequential safety condition.
An explanation is optional, including under a page title. Do not fill every
available subtitle or helper slot just because the component supports it.

Entry pages help selection. Operation pages explain execution. Result pages
explain outcomes. Do not put protocol implementation details, setup instructions
or descriptions of the next screen on every directory card.

Keep information that affects safety or interpretation visible at the decision
point: disruptive network changes, authentication consequences, unavailable
data, stale measurements and test scope must not disappear as part of simplification.
Secondary diagnostics and raw technical evidence can be disclosed separately
with clear labels.

## Languages and shared terminology

The UI supports English and Simplified Chinese. Keep English source messages
and their Chinese translations together through `t()` and
`web/src/lib/locales/zh-CN.ts`; reuse messages rather than inventing synonyms.
Use 网关 for Gateway, 出口 for Uplink / Way out, 接入 for Access, 地址池 for
Address ranges and 地址预留 for Reserved addresses. Translate status and actions
without changing protocol identifiers, addresses, commands, user names or API data.
Keep technical backend errors verbatim so operators can diagnose them.

Language selection is browser-local, persists across reloads and synchronizes
between tabs. On first visit, use Chinese for a Chinese browser preference and
English otherwise; unsupported languages fall back to English. Switching languages
updates the document language and visible controls without resetting forms or
restarting queries. Keep the switch available before login and initial setup.
New messages without a translation fall back to English. Translate complete
sentences with named placeholders when values are embedded; do not assemble new
sentences from translated fragments. Keep state decisions independent of copy.

## Naming and writing

Use familiar tool names and concise task labels. Keep distinctions in the name
when they help selection: Internet speed test and LAN link test identify different
measurement boundaries. Preserve established names such as Ping, NAT test and
Traceroute. Do not invent broad category labels for a single item.

Name a state for what it means for the user, not for how it is carried out. The
IPv6 DNS card on Gateway reads IPv6 disabled, not AAAA filtered: dropping AAAA
records is one way to reach that state, and the mechanism only answers the
question for a reader who already knows the record type. The setting's own page
may keep the mechanism's name, because there the operator is choosing it; a
status that reports the outcome names the outcome. The Forwarding card follows
the same rule: devices reach the internet or they do not, and which sysctl was
written is not something the operator can see or act on. The card's title stays
the module's own word, because the switch it reports is the one in the Gateway
routing card at interfaces#forwarding.

Avoid repeating the title in a description, stating obvious click behavior or
adding a generic next-step sentence. Use one short sentence when an explanation
is necessary. Keep essential text readable; reducing font size is not a remedy
for excessive content.

Keep the footer to the product copyright, Credits, version and the icon-only GitHub,
theme and language controls. On desktop, bottom-align the visible content with 12px
bottom padding. The row stays on one line, so phones keep the year alone in the
copyright instead of the product name the header already carries. Describe the
current and next theme, and the language in use and the one a click switches to, in
their accessible labels and tooltips, and name GitHub in the accessible label and
tooltip of its mark.

## Capability and richness

Device icon selection supports the same theSVG library as site logos. Choosing
a library logo changes only the picture, preserving the device category. Keep
automatic detection available and show a clear empty result for unmatched searches.

Show the real capability set together with consistent visual weight. Keep entries
compact enough to scan across the set. Richness comes from recognizable, distinct
capabilities, useful data and dependable interactions. Do not inflate it with
oversized panels, redundant labels, decorative badges or unavailable features.

Use a consistent ordering. Add grouping when the collection is large enough that
groups reduce search effort; add search when scanning the collection becomes
burdensome. Five tools need neither filters nor one category per card.

## Advanced directory reference

Advanced's goals are quick selection, a current answer and a calm presentation.
Its contract is:

- Three groups with charters: System (the machine and what may reach it),
  Services (background work for the network), Diagnostics (measurements).
  Place a feature by its charter, not by which module happens to own it.
- One tile per destination, with a capital initial on a 64px tinted tile. The
  tiles of a group share one hue; the letter carries identity.
- A tile that names an upstream tool takes that project's name and its app icon
  (NextTrace opens Traceroute); a tile that is a protocol or OLR's own
  measurement keeps its initial.
- One line of name below the tile, never wrapped, and nothing printed under it.
  Keep the tile's name short enough for one line; the page behind it may carry
  the longer name (Admin access opens Administrator access).
- Function and state appear on hover/focus and in the tile's accessible name.
- The whole tile is a keyboard-accessible link; no dialog opens on click.
- There is no intermediate "Tools" page: a diagnostic tile opens the tool.
- Keep explanations, requirements and results on the individual pages.

## Review before shipping

- Can the primary information be identified without reading every paragraph?
- Does each supporting line change a decision or explain a necessary constraint?
- Is any information repeated across title, description, badge and action?
- Are instructions shown at the step where they are used?
- Does simplifying preserve warnings, measurement scope and unavailable states?
- Can users scan the capability set on desktop and find entries on a phone?
- Do imagery, whitespace and type reinforce the same information hierarchy?

Update both guides when changing a shared presentation contract.
