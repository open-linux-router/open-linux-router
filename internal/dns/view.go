// design.md §4.5: the model and the query interface are ours, always —

// returns" is a deliberate decision rather than a side effect of which fields
// happened to be exported, and so that a change to an internal struct does not
// silently become a breaking API change.

// only actionable next to the lines that caused it — "disruptive" with no diff
// is a scarier spinner, not an explanation.
