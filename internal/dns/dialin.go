// The address a device that dials in resolves through.
//
// `remote` writes `DNS = <this box's address on the dial-in network>` into
// every client configuration it prints, and prints it once — the file lives on
// a phone afterwards and cannot be reissued (docs/remote-access.md §6.3). So
// answering on that address is not a convenience an operator can be asked to
// arrange; it is the other half of a promise `remote` has already made.
//
// It used to be neither module's job, and that is what "connected but offline"
// is: a listen pin of 172.16.1.1 answers at home, the tunnel's 10.6.0.1 answers
// nowhere, and every lookup from the phone gets ICMP port-unreachable while the
// tunnel itself looks perfectly healthy. Both modules were internally
// consistent; nobody owned the intersection.
//
// The direction is `remote` publishes and `dns` subscribes — the same shape as
// ingress→dns in design.md §4.1, and for the same reason: the fact has one
// owner, and the module that has to act on it reads it rather than keeping a
// copy. The reverse direction is not available even though it looks tidier,
// because a client configuration naming an address we decided to stop serving
// cannot be repaired from here.
//
// This is a structural rule, not an `auto` mode (design.md §5.6): the address
// is part of the tunnel's declared intent, so answering on it is a
// consequence of role, like "never serve DHCP on a WAN interface". There is no
// switch, because a switch would be a way to break the promise again.

// DialInView is this module's read-only window onto the remote-access module.
