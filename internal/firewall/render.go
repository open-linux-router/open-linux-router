// Rendering the ruleset a config asks for.
//
// Pure, for the reason internal/gateway/nat's render.go gives: Render returns a
// value, the planner diffs it against what the kernel holds, the tests assert
// on it, and only kernel_linux.go turns it into netlink. The ruleset is
// docs/firewall.md §3, and it is short enough to read in one go:
//
//	input    (to this router)          forward  (through it)
//	  established, related  accept       established, related  accept
//	  loopback              accept       from inside           accept
//	  from inside           accept       not toward inside     accept
//	  icmp, icmpv6          accept       port forwards (dnat)  accept
//	  dhcp, dhcpv6 client   accept       icmpv6 echo, errors   accept
//	  each opening          accept       drop
//	  drop
//
// Both chains end in an explicit counted `drop` under an `accept` policy rather
// than carrying `policy drop`. The verdict is the same; the counter is what
// lets the status screen say how much was turned away, and a policy has none.
