// design.md §4.5: the model and the query interface are ours, always. These
// types exist so that "what the HTTP API returns" is a deliberate decision
// rather than a side effect of which fields happened to be exported.

// planView is a Plan with the diffs included.
//
// Plan omits file contents from JSON because a rendered config is long and the
// CLI does not always want them. The UI does: §5.3.3's impact classification is
// only actionable next to the lines that caused it.
//
// The credential is not a special case here, and deliberately so — Change.Diff
// already withholds a secret file's contents, so this type cannot leak one by
// forgetting to. Putting the rule in the renderer of the diff rather than in
// each consumer is what makes "every surface" true rather than aspirational.
