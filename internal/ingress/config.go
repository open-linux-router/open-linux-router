// ModuleName is the path segment, config section and event label for this
// module.
//
// Neither `proxy` nor `gateway` was available: docs/gateway.md uses both for
// traffic on its way *out* — an exit, and the operator's proxy box. This
// module is the other direction, so it needed a third word.
const ModuleName = "ingress"

// Config is the ingress module's intent: which internal services are reachable
// by name, and what it takes to serve them over HTTPS.
//
// It is the single source for the CLI flags, the REST body, the UI form and the
// MCP tool definition (design.md §3.2 rule 3).
//
// The domain is here, and it is this module's own fact. It was `dns.LocalDomain`
// for a while, on the theory that one namespace for the whole box could not
// drift; what that actually bought was a published name that only existed if
// this module also wrote it into the resolver, and a network-wide rename forced
// on anybody who wanted one service over HTTPS (docs/ingress.md §3). It is not
// the resolver's domain any more: the records live in public DNS, where the
// operator puts them, and what the resolver answers is a separate question.
//
// Which leaves exactly one thing this module must know about the resolver: a
// published domain that falls *inside* the zone the resolver answers
// authoritatively would never be asked of public DNS at all, so validate.go
// refuses it. That read is the whole of the coupling.
type Config struct {
	// Enabled controls whether the proxy runs at all. Disabling stops the
	// service and leaves the configuration in place, so published services can
	// be turned back on without retyping them.
	Enabled bool `json:"enabled"`

	// Domain is the suffix published names live under, e.g. `home.example.com`.
	//
	// Owned here rather than by `dns`, and deliberately not the same value: the
	// wildcard certificate is for `*.<this>`, the records the operator writes
	// point at this box, and neither has anything to do with what the resolver
	// calls the devices in the house.
	//
	// One label, though: the wildcard covers `grafana.<domain>` and not
	// `grafana.lab.<domain>`, so a deeper suffix would only move the problem.
	Domain string `json:"domain,omitempty"`

	// Certificate is how the wildcard is obtained. One certificate serves every
	// published name, which is what makes adding a service a two-field
	// operation (docs/ingress.md §1).
	Certificate Certificate `json:"certificate"`

	// Services are the published names, keyed by Name.
	Services []Service `json:"services,omitempty"`

	// ExtraConf is the module's declared escape hatch (design.md §3.2 rule 5):
	// appended verbatim to the rendered Caddyfile. Caddy can do vastly more
	// than publish an internal service, and this field plus the upstream
	// documentation is the whole of our answer to all of it.

// Certificate holds what ACME needs and nothing else.
//
// DNS-01 is the only challenge that works for a name which does not resolve
// from outside, and docs/ingress.md §4 records why the other two are dead:
// HTTP-01 would mean exposing the router to get a certificate for something
// that is not exposed, and a local CA would mean installing a root certificate
// on every phone, TV and console on the network.

	//
	// This is the first credential for a third-party account olr has ever
	// held, and there is no secrets store to put it in (docs/ingress.md §4.1).
	// It therefore lives in the config document like any other field, with two
	// obligations that the rest of this module has to keep:
	//
	//   - it is redacted on every surface that prints config or a plan diff,
	//     because `olr ingress plan` showing an operator their own API token in
	//     a terminal is how tokens end up in bug reports; and
	//   - it is rendered into an environment file the unit reads, never into
	//     the Caddyfile, so that the file we might reasonably show somebody
	//     never contains it in the first place.
	//
	// Scope it to the one zone if the provider supports it. The setup copy
	// should say so, because the blast radius of an account-wide key here is
	// the operator's whole DNS.
	Token string `json:"provider_token,omitempty"`

	// Email is the ACME account contact. Optional; Let's Encrypt uses it only
	// to warn about expiry, which is a warning we would rather they received.
	Email string `json:"acme_email,omitempty"`

	// Resolvers are the DNS servers Caddy uses to confirm the challenge record
	// has propagated.
	//
	// They are public resolvers by default, and the reason is narrower than it
	// used to be. This box's own resolver is not authoritative for the
	// published domain any more (§3), so it *can* see the `_acme-challenge`
	// record — but it also applies this network's blocking policies and
	// whatever the upstream does, and the one lookup that must not be
	// mistaken for a failure is the one that decides whether a certificate is
	// issued. Asking two resolvers that are not ours keeps that question away
	// from every filter we render.
	Resolvers []string `json:"resolvers,omitempty"`

// DefaultResolvers are public resolvers used only for ACME propagation checks.
//
// Two, from different operators, because this is the one lookup on the box that
// must not depend on our own resolver (see Certificate.Resolvers).
//
// **Two is not redundancy**, which is the opposite of what this comment used to
// claim. Caddy's propagation check asks every listed resolver in turn, and an
// unreachable one fails the check outright: a real box behind an ISP that drops
// traffic to 9.9.9.9 logged `dial tcp 9.9.9.9:53: i/o timeout` on every attempt
// and never obtained a certificate, while 1.1.1.1 beside it answered fine. So
// the list is chosen for being reachable from the most networks, not for
// diversity, and an operator on a network that blocks one of these replaces it
// in `resolvers` rather than adding to it.
//
// This is not a privacy leak worth worrying about: the only names asked are
// `_acme-challenge` records the operator is simultaneously publishing to the
// public DNS, and the CA is about to query them from the outside anyway.
