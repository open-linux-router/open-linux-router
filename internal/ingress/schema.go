// Core reflects the config struct into the schema that drives the REST body, the
// UI form and the MCP tool definition (design.md §3.2 rule 3). Core can tell
// that these marshal as strings; only this package knows *which* strings are
// legal, so the vocabulary is declared next to the parser that enforces it.
//
// Value receivers, because that is what invopop detects.

// JSONSchema publishes the upstream scheme vocabulary as an enum.

// The legal set is whatever the operator's proxy binary was built with
// (providers.go), which is not knowable at reflection time. An enum here could
// therefore only ever be a guess, and a guess that a form renders as a closed
// dropdown is worse than no list at all: it would offer names the binary does
// not have and hide the one it does.
//
// The live list is a request away — GET /api/ingress/providers, or `olr ingress
// show providers` — and a form that wants a dropdown should fetch it.
