// Package link owns which interfaces the operator has handed to olr, and the
// networks those interfaces carry.
//
// # What this is, and what it is not
//
// design.md §9 milestone 1 owes a `link` module that brings up interfaces,
// carries addressing, and lands the network object (§4.4) every module after it
// keys off. This is now most of that module:
//
//   - **Adoption** — the list of interface names the operator handed over. Pure
//     consent: storing it changes nothing on the box. It exists because the
//     adopt-only rule (§3.4, §7) was being enforced by three modules against a
//     fact that had nowhere to live, and a safety rule nobody can satisfy is
//     not a safety rule.
//   - **Networks** (§4.4). A network names a subnet and this box's address on
//     it, and applying one *does* reach the kernel. This is the half
//     that was missing, and its absence had a specific cost: `dhcp` could only
//     validate a range against whatever address an interface had been given
//     from outside olr, so an operator who wanted a different subnet met an
//     error that no page in olr could fix. olrd puts the address back when it
//     starts (Applier.Restore), because the kernel forgets it on a reboot and
//     nothing else on the box knows it.
//
// Still owed, and deliberately not invented here: bridges, VLANs, and taking an
// interface away from NetworkManager, systemd-networkd or ifupdown. The last of
// those has a cost design.md §7 states: until it lands, a member interface has
// two managers that do not know about each other, and only the operator can
// make them agree — docs/install.md says how. `Network.Members` is a list so that
// the day bridging lands the schema is already right, but Validate requires
// exactly one member until something exists that can create a bridge device.
//
// The observed half of an interface's facts — its current addresses, whether it
// is up — is still read from the kernel per request and never stored. There is
// no copy to drift (§4.5). What a network stores is *intent*: the subnet we want,
// not the subnet that is there. Apply is what closes the gap between them, and
// the difference between the two is drift rather than a second opinion.

	// there was nowhere in olr to say "this LAN is 172.16.1.0/24", so `dhcp`
