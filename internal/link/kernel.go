// The observed half of an interface: what the kernel says right now.
//
// Never stored. design.md §4.5 is the rule — own the model, never the state —
// and this is the half of §7 that was previously kept in a hand-written
// `--links` file. That file was a second copy of a fact the kernel already
// held, with nothing to keep the two in step: an operator who renumbered an
// interface would get pools validated against the address it used to have. A
// syscall per request is a small price for that class of bug not existing.

// Interface is one kernel interface, as read.
type Interface struct {
	// Name is the kernel name, and the key every other module uses.
	Name string

	// Index is the kernel's ifindex. Published because it is the one stable
	// handle when a name is ambiguous in a log, not because anything keys on it.
	Index int

	// Up is the administrative state — the operator has brought the interface
	// up. It is what "configured" means and is the flag the other modules test.
	Up bool

	// Running is the operational state: a carrier is present. Reported
	// separately rather than folded into Up because the two disagree in ways
	// worth seeing — an up interface with no cable in it is the single most
	// common reason a new DHCP server appears to do nothing — and because some
	// drivers never set it, so treating a false here as "down" would hide
	// working interfaces on those.
	Running bool

	// Loopback marks lo. Kept so that callers can exclude it by what it is
	// rather than by matching its name.
	Loopback bool

	// HardwareAddr is the MAC, empty for interfaces that have none.
	HardwareAddr string

	// Prefixes are the addresses configured on the interface, with masks.
	//
	// Link-local addresses are excluded: fe80::/10 and 169.254.0.0/16 are
	// present on essentially every interface and are never the subnet an
	// operator means. Including them would put an identical fe80::/64 on every
	// row of the interface list, and would hand `gateway` a source prefix that
	// matches every network on the box at once.

// A function rather than an interface with one method, because that is all it

// against, and CI has none worth serving DHCP on.
