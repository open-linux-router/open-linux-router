// The seam between the decision layer and the kernel.
//
// design.md §10 requires netlink, nftables and systemd to sit behind an
// interface so that everything else is unit-testable off Linux, and §3.6 notes
// that this testability seam is also the privilege-separation seam if that
// split is ever taken. This module leans on it harder than the others do: dhcp
// and dns render files that can be asserted on anywhere, while what this one
// produces *is* kernel state, so without a seam there would be nothing to test
// on a machine that is not a router.

// ErrUnsupported is returned by a kernel that cannot do this at all.
var ErrUnsupported = errors.New("routing needs a Linux kernel with nftables and policy routing")

// Kernel is the window onto what this module programs.
//
// Two methods and no more. Every decision — which prefix gets which mark, what
// happens to IPv6, whether a change is disruptive — is made above this line
// against values, so an implementation of it has no policy in it at all.

	// Observe reads the live state, fresh. Planning against observation rather
	// than against a cached copy of what we last wrote is what makes drift
	// detection free (design.md §5.4).

	// Traffic reads the accounting sets (§7.1).
	//
	// Separate from Observe because it is asked at a different rate and for a
	// different reason: Observe answers "does the kernel match intent" on every
	// plan, while this answers "who used the bandwidth" on a screen somebody is
	// watching. Folding them together would make every apply pay for a walk of
	// every device on the network.

	//
	// It returns steps alongside an error rather than instead of one. There is
	// no rollback here on purpose (design.md §5.2/§5.3.2): if a multi-step
	// change fails halfway the steps that landed stay landed and are reported,
	// and re-running finishes the job. That is more honest and more debuggable
	// than a silent revert — and on this module a revert would itself be a
	// routing change, with its own chance of failing.

// Flow is one device's traffic through one exit, as the kernel counts it.

// has to be one where traffic is either handled correctly or not classified at
// all — never classified toward something that does not exist yet:
//
//	routes  →  ip rules  →  nft marks        (installing)
//	nft marks  →  ip rules  →  routes        (removing)
//
// Get it backwards and there is a window where a packet is marked for a table
// whose default route has not been created, so the lookup misses, the RPDB
// falls through to `main`, and the traffic the operator asked to route goes out
// direct. It is a window of milliseconds and it is a silent leak, which is the
// combination this module works hardest to avoid.
