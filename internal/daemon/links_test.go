// The bug this whole path exists to fix, pinned.
//
// Before the link module, olrd was started by its own systemd unit with no
// --links flag, so `dhcp` was handed an empty interface list and refused every
// pool with "no such interface" — a packaged install could not configure DHCP
// at all. Even with a file, the pool needed `adopted: true`, and `olr adopt`
// was a stub, so the flag was unreachable from every supported surface.
//
// These tests assert the fix through the adapter olrd actually uses. What the
// adapter hands `dhcp` changed shape here: it used to be an interface with its
// observed addresses, and it is now a network with its stored subnet — so a
// range is checked against something an operator can change from inside olr.
