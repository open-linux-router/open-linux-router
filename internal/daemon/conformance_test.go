// about the CLI's — internal/core cannot import the modules that import it, so a
// test that wants to see every module's real surface has to sit where they are
// all already in scope. That commit also supplies the cautionary tale: the CLI's
// conformance tests walked a tree the modules were never mounted into, so they
// passed for a year while three surfaces drifted apart.
//
// Routes() is called on a zero-valued HTTP struct. It reads none of its fields —
// it only takes method values — so no applier, socket or kernel is needed to ask
// a module what it serves.
