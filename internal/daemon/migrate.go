// Migrating an old document, in the one place that can.
//
// Two conversions live here, and they share a write rather than a reason.
//
// # Pools keyed by interface (pre-0.3)
//
// A pool used to be keyed by kernel interface and to carry its own IPv4 range.
// It is now keyed by a network, and the network owns the subnet. Converting the
// pool itself is `dhcp`'s job and it does it while parsing (dhcp.LegacyPool) —
// but the *key* names an object `dhcp` does not own and cannot invent. Only
// this package sees both modules, so this is where a network gets created for
// each interface that had a pool.
//
// # Why at startup rather than on first write
//
// The alternative is to leave the old document alone and convert on the way
// past, every time. That means every surface carries the old shape forever, the
// two shapes have to agree about everything, and `olr.json` — which design.md
// §10 says is the recovery path you SSH in and read — has a schema that depends
// on when the box was installed. One conversion, written back once, keeps the
// file honest.
//
// # What it deliberately does not do
//
// It does not touch the kernel. The network it creates carries the subnet the
// interface *already has*, so applying it is a no-op on a box that was working
// — nobody's addresses move because olr was upgraded. If the interface has no
// IPv4 address the network is created without a subnet, which validates as a
// warning rather than an error and leaves the operator a row to fix instead of
// a parse failure.
//
// # The network spelled `group` (pre-rename)
//
// The network object was called `group` in the schema, the API and the code
// while every page and command called it a network. The word is now kept for
// sets of devices, so the stored keys moved: `link.groups` became
// `link.networks` and a pool's `group` became `network`. Reading the old keys
// is each module's job, and each does it while parsing (link.UnmarshalConfig,
// dhcp.UnmarshalConfig). Writing the new ones back is this file's, for the same
// reason as above — one conversion, written once, keeps the file honest — and a
// pre-0.3 document goes through both conversions in the same write, since the
// pools and networks it creates are marshalled in the current shape anyway.

// migrateDocument converts an old configuration in place, returning whether
// anything changed.
//
// It is idempotent: a document already in the current shape parses as one, so
// dhcp.Config.Legacy is empty, neither module reports an old key, and there is
// nothing to do. Everything it changes is written in one store.Save.
