// The module's REST surface (design.md §3.2 rule 2, §6.2).
//
// Deliberately thin: every decision here was made and tested in config.go,
// validate.go, plan.go and apply.go. If a rule appears in this file that is not
// in one of those, it is in the wrong place — the CLI would not get it.
//
// One thing genuinely does live here and nowhere else, and it is the exception
// that proves the rule: **creating a peer is the only operation in olr whose
// response cannot be reproduced.** The client configuration is generated,
// returned, and forgotten, so the code that hands it back has to sit inside the
// same locked edit that stored the peer.

// wireguardRoutes is the tunnel's half of the module's surface.
//
// Under its own prefix rather than at the module root, which is the change the
// second object forced. The two objects plan and apply completely differently,
// so a shared `/config` would have to own a plan covering both — and a caller
// editing a cipher would be told about a kernel interface.
