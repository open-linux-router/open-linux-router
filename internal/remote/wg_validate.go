// Validation is the highest-value mechanism in the apply story (design.md
// §5.3.1), and this module leans on it for a reason particular to what it
// produces: **a client configuration leaves the box.** Every other module's
// mistakes stay here and are fixed by re-applying. A peer's file is copied to a
// phone, and a subnet or an endpoint that was wrong when it was written is
// wrong on somebody's device until they notice and come back.
//
// It is pure — no files, no network, no root — so the whole rule set is
// table-tested and `olr remote` can check a config on a laptop.

// MaxInterfaceNameLen is the kernel's IFNAMSIZ minus the terminator.
//
// Declared here rather than imported from `link`, which has the same constant.
// That is not duplication to remove: this module states the facts it depends on
// and imports no other module (design.md §4.1), and a constant the kernel fixes
// is the cheapest possible thing to state twice.
