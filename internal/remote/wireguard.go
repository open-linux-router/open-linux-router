// The WireGuard object: the one that puts a device *inside* the network.
//
// That is the whole difference from the object beside it, and it is what an
// operator has to understand before choosing between them. A WireGuard peer
// reaches the NAS, the printer and this router's own UI, because it is a device
// on a network at home. A Shadowsocks client reaches none of those; it borrows
// this box's way out and nothing else (shadowsocks.go).
//
// Unlike every other backend-driven object in olr, this one has no unit.
// WireGuard's data path is in the kernel, so what it configures *is* kernel
// state — which makes it shaped like internal/gateway, applied at olrd startup
// because a reboot is what kernel state does not survive.

// DefaultInterface is the kernel name of the tunnel olr creates.
//
// `wg0` and not `olr-wg0`, which would have matched the naming everywhere else
// in olr. Two reasons went the other way: every piece of WireGuard
// documentation an operator will read says `wg0`, and unlike a unit name or a
// config path there is nothing here to collide with — a box already running
// WireGuard on `wg0` is a box this module refuses to touch (wg_validate.go)
// rather than one it has to coexist with on the same name.
const DefaultInterface = "wg0"

// tells an operator to forward.
const DefaultListenPort = 51820

// DefaultKeepalive is how often a peer sends a keepalive packet, in seconds.
//
// Rendered into every client configuration rather than offered as a field. A
// peer behind NAT is reachable from home only while the NAT mapping is open, so
// without this the operator's phone is contactable for a minute after it last
// spoke and then silently is not — which is precisely the situation somebody
// notices at the worst moment. 25 is upstream's recommendation and sits below
// every NAT timeout worth worrying about.
const DefaultKeepalive = 25

// DefaultSubnet is the dial-in network when the operator does not choose one.
//
// Arbitrary, and chosen only to be unlikely: home networks cluster on
// 192.168.0.0/16 and the low end of 10.0.0.0/8, and a default that collided
// with the LAN would produce a tunnel that comes up and reaches nothing. An
// overlap is refused rather than worked around (wg_validate.go), so the cost of
// a bad guess here is one clear error naming `--subnet`.

	// Interface is the kernel name. Empty means DefaultInterface.

	//
	// This is a network in design.md §4.4's sense and behaves like one in every
	// respect but the one that matters most: **its addresses are not served.**
	// They are written into each client configuration when it is generated,
	// because the address has to be known before the tunnel that would carry a
	// DHCP request exists. docs/remote-access.md §3.2 is that asymmetry, and it
	// is why changing this field is disruptive even though nothing disconnects
	// at the instant it is applied — every configuration already on a phone
	// becomes wrong.
	Subnet netip.Prefix `json:"subnet,omitempty"`

	// Address is this box's own address on the dial-in network. Nil derives the

	//
	// It carries the obligations docs/ingress.md §4.1 states for the other

	// plan, and never returned by the API. Unlike those it is generated here

	PublicKey string `json:"public_key"`

	// Address is the peer's address on the dial-in network, allocated when the
	// peer is added and fixed for its lifetime.
	//
	// Stored rather than derived from position in the list: deriving would
