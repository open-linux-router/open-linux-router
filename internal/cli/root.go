// Command groups.
//
// The split matters: most of olr is a client of olrd's HTTP API, on equal
// footing with the WebUI and the MCP server (design.md §1). But a few commands
// manage olrd itself and so cannot go through it — they must work when the
// daemon is down. Those live in GroupService.
//
// GroupService is where design.md §6.1's lower tier became visible after the
// `olr daemon` group was flattened away. The tier is real and unchanged; what
// went is the word in front of it. An operator has one program installed and
// thinks of it as one program, so `olr start` is what they reach for — and the
// heading, not the command path, is what says these do not go through the API.
