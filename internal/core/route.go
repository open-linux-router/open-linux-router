// A module's HTTP surface, declared as data.
//
// Every module used to call mux.HandleFunc inline inside its Handler, which
// made the surface unenumerable: http.ServeMux has no introspection, so nothing
// outside a module could ask what routes it serves. That cost nothing while the
// only readers were the WebUI and the CLI — both hand-written against routes
// they already know, both maintained by somebody who can read the file.
//
// It stops being free at the third reader. design.md §6.4 wants MCP tools
// *generated* rather than written, and §9 milestone 5 owes an OpenAPI document;
// neither can be derived from a surface that can only be discovered by reading
// Go. So the table is the source and the mux is built from it, which is the
// same move §3.2 rule 3 already makes for config structs: declare it once, and
// let every surface be a projection of that declaration rather than a second
// copy maintained in parallel.
//
// What this deliberately does *not* do is describe responses. Config structs
// are reflected (schema.go); read and plan shapes are not, and §6.2 names that
// as an open gap. A Route says what you may call and what a request body must
// look like — not what comes back.

// BodyShape names the schema projection a request body is validated against.
//
// It is the projection and not a Go type because the schema is what every
// generated surface consumes: an MCP tool's inputSchema is the projection
// verbatim, so naming the projection here is naming the tool's arguments.

// QueryParam is one query-string parameter a route accepts.
//
// Declared because a generated surface has no other way to learn it. The route
// table is the only description of a module's inputs that exists outside its Go
// source: an MCP tool built from a route with no declared parameters is a tool
// that cannot pass ?limit=, and dns's query log without a limit is the whole
// log. Path parameters need no equivalent — they are visible in Path.

	// Summary is one line saying what the route answers or does.
	//
	// Required, and required for a reason that is not tidiness: this is the
	// text an agent reads to decide whether to call the route at all. A tool
	// whose description is empty is a tool the model will either ignore or
	// guess at, and guessing is the failure mode with a router on the other
	// end. RouteTable panics on a route without one.
	Summary string `json:"summary"`

	// Tool is this route's name in the shared surface vocabulary, spelled the
	// way the CLI spells it: "show", "show leases", "status", "plan". The MCP
	// server joins the words with underscores, so `olr dhcp show leases` and
	// the tool `dhcp_show_leases` are visibly the same thing said twice rather
	// than two things that happen to overlap.
	//
	// Empty means the route is deliberately not published as a tool.

	// Read from, among other places, the MCP tool annotations: readOnlyHint on
	// everything without it, destructiveHint on everything with it.

//
// It panics on a malformed table — a missing summary, a missing handler, a

// keyboard and none of them is a runtime condition, so the same reasoning
// applies as to Mount panicking on a duplicate module name: fail at startup,
// where it is unmissable, rather than serving a surface that is quietly wrong.
