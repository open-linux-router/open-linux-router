// Category detection: a guess, labelled as a guess, that an operator can
// override permanently.
//
// The governing rule comes from icon-style-spec.md, and it is about honesty
// rather than accuracy. A device inventory whose pictures are subtly wrong is
// worse than one that admits it only knows the category — so every rule here
// either fires on strong evidence or does not fire at all. There is no
// "probably a laptop because the vendor mostly makes laptops": a miss falls
// through to an unset category, the UI says nothing, and the operator's answer
// is asked for instead of guessed at.
//
// Two signals, in this order:
//
//  1. **Hostname.** What the client calls itself. Much the stronger signal, and
//     the one the operator can verify by looking at the device, which matters
//     when they are deciding whether to trust the guess.
//  2. **OUI.** The vendor half of the MAC, read twice. ouiTable below is a
//     short hand-placed list, and it is the only thing here allowed to produce
//     a *category*, because it only lists vendors that make one kind of thing.
//     internal/devices/ouidb is the IEEE registry and produces a *vendor name*
//     for almost any globally-assigned address — and never a category, because
//     knowing Apple registered a prefix says nothing about whether the device
//     is a phone, a watch, a laptop or a TV box. That asymmetry is why Vendor
//     and Category are separate fields rather than one answer.
//
// Neither signal reaches a locally-administered address, which is most phones
// and laptops now that MAC randomisation is on by default. Those get no vendor
// and no category, and the screen has to be readable anyway.

// Detected is what inference produced. Category may be empty, and that is a
// result rather than a failure — it means nothing here was confident enough.

// network switch, and a coin flip does not belong in an inventory.

	// laptop, not a phone), "echo" begins "echolab".
	//
	// The cost is a miss on forms like "nas01". That is the right way round to
	// fail: a device that falls through to unset gets asked about once and the
	// answer is stored forever, whereas a confidently wrong category is a
	// picture the operator has to notice is wrong before they can fix it.

// ouiTable is the hand-maintained overlay on top of the IEEE registry.

// It used to be the whole vendor lookup: forty prefixes standing in for a
// database nobody had written. internal/devices/ouidb is that database now, and
// this table kept the two jobs a registry cannot do.
//
//  1. **Category.** IEEE records who registered a prefix and stops there. That a
//     Raspberry Pi Foundation OUI means a single-board computer is a judgement
//     about a product line, and it lives here because a person made it.
//  2. **The name we would rather print.** The registry says "Signify
//     Netherlands"; the label under the lamp in someone's hall should say
//     "Philips Hue". The generator carries an alias list for the general case,
//     but an entry here wins over both, and wins as a unit.
//
// So it stays small — smaller than it was, in fact. Every vendor-only entry is
// gone: twenty hand-copied Apple, Samsung, Intel, Ubiquiti and TP-Link prefixes
// were a worse answer than the registry's fifteen hundred, and keeping them
// would have implied this table was still where vendors come from. What is left
// all carries a category, which is the thing the registry genuinely cannot
// supply.
//
// Being unlisted is no longer a dead end: a prefix that misses here falls
// through to the registry for its vendor, and to no category at all — the
// honest outcome, and the one an operator fixes by naming the device once.
//
// Keyed by 24-bit prefix, lower-case and colon-separated, the form core.OUI
// returns. The registry's 28- and 36-bit blocks are ouidb's business; nothing
// worth a hand-written category has yet needed finer than an MA-L.
