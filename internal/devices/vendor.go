// VendorKey is a stable slug for a vendor we might one day draw a picture of.
//
// It exists because Vendor is a *label* and an icon needs a *key*. "TP-Link"
// is what goes under a device; `tp-link` is what names a file. Deriving one
// from the other in the UI would work right up until someone improved a name
// in the generator's alias list — the label would get better and every picture
// keyed on it would silently stop resolving. Sending both means the two cannot
// drift, because the same table decides them.
//
// The vocabulary is closed and small, for the reason Category's is (see
// category.go): an open slug space would mean artwork keyed on whatever
// spelling the registry happened to use that year, and no way to check a key
// against anything. Closed also makes the guarantee testable — every value
// below is asserted to be reachable from a real hardware address, so a key can
// never be added for a vendor no device can produce.
//
// Absence is the normal case and is not a failure. Most of the 29,838 vendors
// in the registry have no key, and a device made by one of them still shows its
// vendor *name*; it just falls through to its category for a picture. Adding a
// key is one line here and one in the UI's VendorKey union.
type VendorKey string

// vendorKeyByName maps a resolved vendor name to its key.
//
// Keyed on the name *after* cleanup and aliasing — the string that actually
// reaches Detected.Vendor, whether it came from ouiTable or from the registry.
// Lower-cased on both sides at lookup so an alias that changes case does not
// break the join.
//
// The set is deliberately a starter: vendors common on a home network whose
// hardware looks like something in particular. Adding to it costs nothing and
// changes nothing until artwork exists, which is the property that lets the
// list grow by whoever happens to be drawing that week.
