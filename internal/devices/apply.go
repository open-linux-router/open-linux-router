// Applier is the read and write path onto stored identity.
//
// It is much thinner than internal/dhcp's, and the reason is worth stating: this
// module has no backend. There is nothing to render, no daemon to reload and no
// port to check, because a device's name and category are facts about how the
// network is described rather than how it is configured. Applying is therefore
// exactly one step — store the document — and the impact is always none.
//
// That is what makes the device list instant-apply under §5.1 with no
// confirmation: renaming a laptop cannot drop a client. The one action on the
// screen that *can* — giving a device a fixed address — belongs to `dhcp` and
// goes through `dhcp`'s plan and its impact gate, which is the correct place
// for it.

// is no list to speak of. This mirrors getStatus in internal/dhcp/http.go, where
// each half of the answer is reported independently and neither can suppress
