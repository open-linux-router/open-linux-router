// Icon is a picture an operator chose for a device, overriding the one its
// category and vendor would pick. Four shapes are legal:
//
//	<vendor>/<category>             a vendor's take on a kind of device: "apple/laptop"
//	<category>/<variant>            one form of a kind of device: "nas/4bay"
//	<vendor>/<category>/<variant>   one form of a vendor's take: "apple/desktop/mini"
//	os/<system>                     an operating system's mark: "os/debian"
//
// The first is the answer to randomised MACs. A modern phone or laptop hides
// its maker from the registry, so the Apple pictures a detected vendor would
// select are unreachable for exactly the devices most likely to be Apple ones;
// letting the operator say so is the only way to get there. The second is for
// machines better known by what they run — a Proxmox host, a Debian VM — where
// a generic server picture says less than the logo does. A variant is for a
// kind of device that comes in shapes too different to share one picture: a
// NAS with eight bays is not the two-bay box, and a Mac mini is not an iMac.
//
// Closed on both halves, like Category and VendorKey, so a stored icon always
// names something the UI can resolve or deliberately fall back from. Whether a
// picture has actually been *drawn* for a given vendor/category pair is the
// UI's business (see IMAGES in the SPA's features/devices/icons.ts): an
// undrawn pair falls back to the category's own picture rather than failing,
// which is what lets the artwork keep growing without a config migration.
