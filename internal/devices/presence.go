// The presence half of a device (design.md §4.4): observed, read through the
// thing that observes it, never stored as truth.
//
// Sources are declared here, by the consumer, for the reasons LinkView gives in
// internal/dhcp/link.go: it states exactly the facts this module needs instead
// of exposing all of another module's surface, and it lets the module be built
// and tested before those sources exist. It also keeps `devices` from importing
// `dhcp` — the lease adapter is wired in cmd/olrd, so the dependency is one
// interface pointing the way the DAG (§4.1) says it should.

// Source names where a sighting came from. It reaches the UI, because "this
// device is here" and "this device took a lease 40 seconds ago" are different
// claims and only one of them is evidence the DHCP server is working.
