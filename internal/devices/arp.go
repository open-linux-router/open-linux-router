// ARP reads the kernel's IPv4 neighbour table.
//
// This is the answer to design.md §10 decision 7. A lease-derived list silently
// omits a statically-addressed printer, and operators notice — so either the
// neighbour table is read, or the screen has to be called "DHCP clients" and
// admit it is not an inventory. Reading it is the better trade, and it is what
// lets the screen honestly be called Devices.
//
// /proc/net/arp rather than netlink, deliberately. go.mod has three direct
// dependencies and that restraint is a stated project value; pulling in a
// netlink library to read a table the kernel already formats as text would be
// the wrong first reach. The cost is that this is IPv4 only — /proc/net/arp has
// no IPv6 half, and ND needs netlink, which is `link`'s problem to solve in
// milestone 1. Because both live behind PresenceSource, ND lands later as a
// third implementation and nothing else moves.
