// What the router remembers about a device that is no longer here: when it was
// last heard from, and the name it last called itself.
//
// Presence says whether a device is here now, and says nothing once it has
// gone: a device that left at breakfast and one that left last month are both
// "away", and a quiet device that is here is only "idle". The map wants the
// one answer that covers all three — "seen 2h ago" — and no source holds it.
// The lease file records an expiry, the neighbour table a state, and neither
// survives the device being gone long enough to matter.
//
// The name has the same shape of problem, from the same cause. A client's name
// arrives with its DHCP lease; the lease is twelve hours by default, so a phone
// left in a bag for two days comes back to the map as a bare MAC. The client
// did not forget who it was — the router did. So both are kept here, and both
// are kept apart from olr.json on purpose. Intent is what an operator said;
// this is what the box observed, and it lives where observations do, under
// /var/lib, in a record that can be deleted at any time and costs nothing but
// history.
//
// **A remembered name is not an operator's name.** It is displayed while no
// source can say anything better, and it carries the time it was heard, so a
// surface can say "this is what it called itself, three days ago". It is never
// promoted into stored intent: that stays something a human typed, and the
// difference between the two is the whole point of the split in design.md §4.4.
//
// **Heard, not listed.** A sighting in the sense of Presence is not evidence:
// the kernel keeps a STALE neighbour entry for a device that left an hour ago,
// and /proc/net/arp reports it as complete. What counts here is the neighbour
// being REACHABLE — the kernel confirmed it answers within the last half
// minute — which is also what any traffic through the router keeps it. A
// device that only ever talks to its neighbours on the same network is not
// heard, the same blind spot the traffic counters have. A name needs no
// neighbour entry: the lease is evidence enough, and it is what outlives a
// sleeping phone.
//
// **Sampled in the background.** The page is not open most of the time, and a
// timestamp or name that only moved while somebody was looking would be a
// record of the operator. Samples are cheap (one netlink dump, one lease file)
// and taken every few seconds; the record is written every few minutes, and on
// the way down, because a router's disk is often flash and a write every sample
// would be wear for nothing.
