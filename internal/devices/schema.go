// JSONSchema publishes the category vocabulary as an enum.
//
// Core reflects the config struct into the schema that drives the REST body,
// the UI form and the MCP tool definition (design.md §3.2 rule 3). Core can see
// that Category marshals as a string, but only this package knows *which*
// strings are legal — so the vocabulary is declared next to the validator that
// enforces it rather than guessed at by the reflector.
//
// This is what makes the category a typed union in TypeScript rather than a
// bare string, which in turn is what makes the UI's category → label map
// exhaustive at compile time: add a value to categories and the web build fails
// until it has a label. A hand-kept list on the TypeScript side would instead
// fail silently at runtime, on the one screen nobody tests.
//
// The value receiver is what invopop detects.
