// NetworkView is this module's read-only window onto the link module.
//
// design.md §4.1 fixes the direction: dhcp depends on link, reads link's facts
// through link, and never keeps its own copy. The interface is declared here,
// by the consumer, so dhcp imports nothing — internal/daemon adapts link's
// neutral shape into this one.
//
// # Why this is keyed by network and not by interface
//
// It used to hand back an interface's *observed* prefixes, and every rule in
// validate.go was written against them. That made a stored range depend on an
// address configured outside olr: a range in a subnet the interface did not
// happen to hold was refused, with no way to change the subnet from anywhere in
// the product. §4.4 always said modules key off the network — `vlan30` is an
// implementation detail, `guest` is the thing somebody named — and `link` now
// owns one, so the subnet arrives as intent rather than as an observation.
//
// What that buys is visible in validate.go: nearly every rule became pure. The
// only facts still read from the machine are whether the members exist and
// whether they are up, and both of those are warnings.
